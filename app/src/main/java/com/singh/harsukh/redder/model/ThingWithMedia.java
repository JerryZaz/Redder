Mother S'ranjii has a story she wishes to tell you.\"*\n\nA circle of cats soon form around the fire, and S'ranjii throws some moon sugar and spices onto the burning coals. The flames change from a bright orange to a deep Coldharbour blue, and then back to their original hue.\n\n*\"If these trees around us could talk, they would have many stories to tell. The same grass that you sit upon tonight has seen its fair share of war and spilt blood. S'ranjii tells you this, and much more, so that you might not suffer the same fate as them.\"*\n\n*\"Back before when you kittens were but and twinkle in Magrus' eye, the renrij to the West looked upon Tenmar in jealousy. They told their Treethanes in Elden Root and Falinesti that Azurah's Forest belonged to the Bosmer, and they should reclaim their lands for their god, Y'ffre. Zukki-ra, the cheiftan of Clan Sencrest warned the Mane that the Elves were planning an invasion, and the Moon-Father sent his most trusted Claws to assist in the defence of Torval.\"*\n\n*\"While all this was happening, Sangiin the Drunk Cat and Sheggorath the Sugar Cat bickered amongst each other. They had both lost many of their followers to Merrunz, after an Elven priest we shall not name travelled south from the Cyrodiil and converted all the Khajiit that he met.\"*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"494kau","from_kind":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"ngasta_kvata_kvakis","media":null,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"num_comments":0,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_35xve","hide_score":true,"edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"removal_reason":null,"stickied":false,"from":null,"is_self":true,"from_id":null,"permalink":"/r/ngasta_kvata_kvakis/comments/494kau/the_cat_who_cried_bosmer/?ref=search_posts","locked":false,"name":"t3_494kau","created":1457246169,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ngasta_kvata_kvakis/comments/494kau/the_cat_who_cried_bosmer/","author_flair_text":null,"quarantine":false,"title":"The Cat Who Cried Bosmer","created_utc":1457217369,"distinguished":null,"mod_reports":[],"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"ups":1}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"domain":"self.nethack","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"nethack","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to get into this game, having fun so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was doing a run, got blinded and started sensing an enemy eventually killed it, walked into the place I killed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kitten corpse&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;:( I&amp;#39;m sad now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Trying to get into this game, having fun so far.\n\nWas doing a run, got blinded and started sensing an enemy eventually killed it, walked into the place I killed it.\n\n\"Kitten corpse\"\n\n:( I'm sad now.","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"494jxw","from_kind":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Denzien2","media":null,"score":0,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"num_comments":1,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_2qo3l","hide_score":true,"edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"removal_reason":null,"stickied":false,"from":null,"is_self":true,"from_id":null,"permalink":"/r/nethack/comments/494jxw/this_game_is_brutal/?ref=search_posts","locked":false,"name":"t3_494jxw","created":1457246021,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nethack/comments/494jxw/this_game_is_brutal/","author_flair_text":null,"quarantine":false,"title":"This game is brutal","created_utc":1457217221,"distinguished":null,"mod_reports":[],"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"ups":0}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"domain":"self.cats","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"cats","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I adopted a 5-6 month old kitten from a local shelter in October.

SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah felt refreshed and frisky. She&amp;#39;d slept more than 10 hours and woken before the first rays of sun peeked over the canopy of trees below. The previous day of travel had worn her out and her muscles were still sore, but now it felt good. She had spent the night cuddled up to the warm, soft form of Emily, and wasn&amp;#39;t surprised to find that her pussy was wet. When was the last time she had shared a bed with anyone? Probably not since childhood, and never naked. She stretched and reached her arms around the other girl to hold her close. Last night had been... incredible? Sweet and warm? Hannah purred at the memory of Emily&amp;#39;s lips on hers, Emily&amp;#39;s fingers inside her. She had never thought she&amp;#39;d have sex with another girl, and she wanted to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily felt Hannah&amp;#39;s stirring and creaked open her eyes. She smiled when she saw Hannah looking back at her, and snuggled in. &amp;quot;Good morning,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah said, &amp;quot;Good morning. Mrs. Carver said that breakfast won&amp;#39;t be served until the sun clears the horizon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you know where?&amp;quot; Emily asked. This was the first time for each of them to visit Dr. Wilcox&amp;#39;s island.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nooooo,&amp;quot; Hannah said, gently cupping Emily&amp;#39;s breast in her hand. Emily was a B-cup, and her boobs fit nicely into Hannah&amp;#39;s hands. &amp;quot;But I&amp;#39;m sure we have a little time.&amp;quot; Hannah&amp;#39;s tongue peeked out to dance over Emily&amp;#39;s nipple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily purred. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not like we have to get dressed or anything,&amp;quot; she said, and they both giggled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah&amp;#39;s hand traced down the curves of Emily&amp;#39;s body, remembering their journey the night before. Emily was athletic, and Hannah enjoyed feeling her lithe, muscular body beneath her soft skin. &amp;quot;Your legs are amazing,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Last night when we were climbing the endless stairs... I was checking out your ass,&amp;quot; Hannah said, and glided her fingers past Emily&amp;#39;s pussy to feel her butt cheeks from between her legs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily squirmed. &amp;quot;That tickles,&amp;quot; she laughed. Hannah&amp;#39;s fingers firmed up and pressed into Emily&amp;#39;s slit, and Emily&amp;#39;s laugh turned into a moan. &amp;quot;I know you were,&amp;quot; Emily said. &amp;quot;Why do you think I went up in front of you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah laughed and dipped her fingers into Emily&amp;#39;s pussy. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re naughty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily grinned. &amp;quot;Maybe, but whose fingers are in whose pussy?&amp;quot; she asked. Hannah curled her fingers inside Emily and rubbed in a gentle circle, and Emily arched her back and pushed down. &amp;quot;Keep doing that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I like it when you say my name,&amp;quot; Hannah said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please, my dearest Hannah, please keep rubbing my pussy!&amp;quot; Emily said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah obliged, and slid her thumb over Emily&amp;#39;s clit. She slowly brought Emily to orgasm and reveled in the girl&amp;#39;s writhing pleasure. Her orgasm didn&amp;#39;t have the fierce urgency of the night before, but Hannah warmed inside as her friend sighed and curled around her arm like a contented kitten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily slowly roused herself, looked out the window at the rising sun, and said, &amp;quot;Your turn!&amp;quot; Then she slid under the covers and between Hannah&amp;#39;s legs. Hannah&amp;#39;s smooth pussy was already really wet, and Emily got a face-full. Hannah intertwined her fingers in Emily&amp;#39;s curly blonde hair and sighed as Emily&amp;#39;s lips and tongue explored her pussy. Emily&amp;#39;s tongue felt small and soft as it traced the edges of Hannah&amp;#39;s pussy lips and teased her clit. After playing for a while, Emily wrapped her lips around Hannah&amp;#39;s clit and began to lick in earnest. The focused attention quickly pushed Hannah over the edge. Her thighs squeezed Emily&amp;#39;s head and her fingers pulled her hair as she came with a loud cry. Emily didn&amp;#39;t relent, but as Hannah&amp;#39;s quivering subsided she began to lick more slowly, in long strokes, lapping up Hannah&amp;#39;s juices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah was grinning from ear to ear when Emily&amp;#39;s head popped back out. She pulled the other girl up to lay on top of her and kissed her face, from forehead to chin and all around, finishing tenderly on her lips. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re amazing, Emily,&amp;quot; she said. Emily sighed and laid her head on Hannah&amp;#39;s breasts and the two girls snuggled just a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You may have already eaten,&amp;quot; Hannah teased, &amp;quot;but I&amp;#39;m hungry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily laughed. &amp;quot;Dr. Wilcox will be there,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;I definitely need a shower.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah agreed and they squeezed into the small shower together, washing each other and drying off with the plush white towels. All the toiletries they needed were stocked in the cabinet, but they had no make-up. They dried and and brushed each other&amp;#39;s hair: Hannah a brunette, Emily a curly blonde. By the time they were ready the sun was above the trees and shining brightly into their tree-top hideaway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah led the way down the winding staircase that spiraled around the trunk of the massive tree. As they descended through the canopy the sunlight dimmed and the breeze grew still. The squawks and whistles of tropical birds and unknown animals enveloped them, a marked contrast from the roaring screams that periodically tore through the silent forest the night before. Maybe the right word was &amp;quot;jungle&amp;quot;, but if so, this portion appeared to be tame. The stairs eventually brought them back to the sign at the base of the tree: &amp;quot;Robinson Tree House&amp;quot;. The path that felt so forbidding last night was well-kept, and a short walk brought the girls to a wider trail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily paused at the intersection. &amp;quot;Do you think there are... any... men here?&amp;quot; she asked. They had been naked since arriving, but also mostly alone. The prospect of meeting a bunch of strangers naked was intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know, but I&amp;#39;m hungry,&amp;quot; Hannah said, and added: &amp;quot;Dr. Wilcox, for one.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily took her hand, and Hannah picked the direction that looked most promising: back towards the airstrip they arrived at yesterday. They had walked only a short way when they heard voices ahead and came upon a group of girls emerging from a round green door set into an embankment along the path. Emily&amp;#39;s grip tightened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh. My. Gosh,&amp;quot; Hannah said. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve got to be kidding.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A sign near the door said, &amp;quot;Bag End&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah released Emily&amp;#39;s hand and hurried forward, oblivious to the three naked girls who had just emerged from the hole. She bent over to examine the door and squealed with glee. &amp;quot;Look, it even has Gandalf&amp;#39;s rune!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The three girls looked at Hannah uncertainly, and then at Emily. There were two brunettes and a blonde, all beautiful, of course. The blonde was a bit taller than the other two and frowned at Hannah&amp;#39;s behavior. &amp;quot;Get a grip,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a door.&amp;quot; The two brunettes with her giggled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah straightened up and said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s from &amp;#39;Lord of the Rings&amp;#39;. Did you sleep in there last night?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The blonde said, &amp;quot;Yep. I didn&amp;#39;t see those movies. Not really my thing. There are all sorts of rooms along the path. You never know what you&amp;#39;re going to get when you visit.&amp;quot; She looked up and down the path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah blushed and shrugged. &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re books. I&amp;#39;m Hannah, and this is Emily. We stayed in the tree house.&amp;quot; Emily waved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The blonde said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m Nicole.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the brunettes, a tiny girl, said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m Ashley. I knew they were books.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other brunette said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m Elizabeth. Nice to meet you. I can show you Bag End later if you want. There are tunnels --&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nicole cut her off. &amp;quot;This is your first time here, am I right?&amp;quot; Hannah and Emily nodded. &amp;quot;Well, follow us to breakfast.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The group of five girls started walking, led by Nicole. Hannah and Emily were full of questions, but where to start?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nicole had been in their position once. &amp;quot;Dr. Wilcox brings us here when he has a customer and wants to show us off. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s all the girls, sometimes just the graduates,&amp;quot; Nicole said, finding her way confidently through the trees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah started putting pieces together in her mind. &amp;quot;So the customer is here to pick out a girl,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;To marry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nicole stared at Hannah like she was a bit slow in the head. &amp;quot;Obviously. One of the graduates. So not any of us. You can tell the graduates because they&amp;#39;ll be wearing black chokers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So why are the rest of us here?&amp;quot; Emily asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley snickered, &amp;quot;Because Dr. Wilcox likes to fuck a bunch of girls at once?&amp;quot; Elizabeth giggled and Emily blushed. From what Hannah knew of men, it sounded likely to be true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nicole said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s more than that. It&amp;#39;s part of the training, I think.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah repeated Mrs. Carver&amp;#39;s words from the night before, &amp;quot;Not everything here is what it seems.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nicole stopped the group. They hadn&amp;#39;t seen anyone else on the path, but she looked around nervously and leaned in close. &amp;quot;I trust Dr. Wilcox with my life. Literally. But he isn&amp;#39;t telling us the whole story.&amp;quot; The other girls were silent for a moment, and Nicole started walking again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The group walked in silence until they emerged from the trees into a grassy clearing. The the surrounding trees cast shadows in the morning sun that covered the whole clearing, but it was still a lot brighter than the path had been, and the girls shaded their eyes with their hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Great, we&amp;#39;re late,&amp;quot; Ashley said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth looked worried. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, it&amp;#39;s not my fault.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were almost a dozen large round tables in the clearing, and the setup reminded Hannah of a wedding reception. Each table had eight to ten girls sitting around it, talking and eating. The mood was jovial, like long-lost friends reunited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At a table set a little apart from the others Hannah saw Dr. Wilcox wearing a white linen robe. To his left sat Shelly, the pilot from yesterday in a blue sun dress, and to his right was a clean-shaven man in his mid-thirties wearing shorts and a Hawaiian shirt. The other seats at the table were occupied by naked girls wearing black chokers. It was then that Hannah noticed other girls in chokers scattered around... Maybe one in ten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of the breakfasters seemed to pay much notice Hannah and others, but Mrs. Carver appeared next to them out of nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Breakfast is out. Serve yourselves,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Except you, Hannah. Dr. Wilcox told me to send you to him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah looked at Emily and shrugged. &amp;quot;See you soon.&amp;quot; She glanced at the other girls. Ashley and Elizabeth were looking for seats, but Nicole met her eyes and reached up to touch her own ear. Listen?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah made hey way between the tables; the grass was wet with dew and some stuck to her feet. It smelled freshly mowed. Why weren&amp;#39;t there any bugs in it? Or anywhere? She felt dozens of eyes on her as she walked naked through the crowd of strangers and her skin reddened, but she refused to cover herself in embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Hannah approached the table Shelly turned her ever-present smile on her, but no one else noticed her. What was the protocol? Hannah had no desire to be switched in front of all these people. Dr. Wilcox and the other man were deep in conversation with one of the graduates. Hannah decided to play it safe: she knelt and assumed her patience position behind and to the side of Dr. Wilcox and waited patiently. Her butt on her heels, her knees spread, her back arched to push her breasts forward, and her arms behind her back gripping her elbows. The wet grass tickled her pussy and made her wiggle a little, and as she struggled to maintain position she noticed for the first time another girl under the table... Sucking Dr. Wilcox&amp;#39;s cock!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah must have made some involuntarily noise of surprise, because it was right then that Dr. Wilcox turned to her. &amp;quot;Hannah, relieve Abigail, she needs some breakfast,&amp;quot; he said, and gestured under the table. The girl, Abigail, slowly lifted her head off of Dr. Wilcox and heaved a deep breath. His cock was hugely erect and dripping wet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abigail deftly crawled out from under the table and licked her lips, then smiled at Hannah. She was tan and blonde with amazing d-cups and an ass to match. She curtsied towards Dr. Wilcox. &amp;quot;All yours,&amp;quot; she whispered to Hannah, and walked off to find a seat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The conversations at the table hadn&amp;#39;t stopped. Hannah crawled forward from her patience position and saw the strange man looking down at her. He looked surprised for a moment, then looked away. Hannah slid between Shelly and Dr. Wilcox and under the table. What was that look for? Did they know each other? Her face burned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah moved between Dr. Wilcox&amp;#39;s legs and approached his penis. She had grown very familiar with it over the past few months of training, having spent many hours with it in her mouth and pussy. Dr. Wilcox said that sucking cock was a primal, cathartic comfort for many girls, and that had certainly proven to be true for Hannah. The first time she had sucked him she had cried like a baby. As she leaned forward and took his warm thickness into her mouth she felt a wave of comfort wash over her, even in this strange environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As she sucked, the conversation above her was muffled by the table and cloth, but she could make out bits and pieces. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s been a over a year,&amp;quot; Dr. Wilcox said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s time. It&amp;#39;s part of the agreement.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other man mumbled something that Hannah couldn&amp;#39;t make out, and then Shelly said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;ll be good for your kids, too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man said something about &amp;quot;Rachel&amp;quot;, and that&amp;#39;s when recognition hit Hannah: she did know this man! They&amp;#39;d met at one of his parents&amp;#39; parties a few years ago, when his wife Rachel had been pregnant with their first child. What was his name? Stanley? He must have recognized her, too. What was going on here? Hannah kept sucking on Dr. Wilcox while her mind whirred.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Girls, you&amp;#39;re dismissed,&amp;quot; Dr. Wilcox said loudly, and the girls at the table immediately started rising to leave. &amp;quot;Not you, Hannah,&amp;quot; he continued. &amp;quot;Rub your pussy while you suck. Keep coming.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, sir,&amp;quot; Hannah mumbled, though who knows if he heard it with a cock in her mouth from under the table. They&amp;#39;d played this game before, training her to orgasm quickly and easily, over and over, while sucking dick. It was usually a lot of fun, but Hannah would have a hard time eavesdropping. She began to rub her clit with her right hand and continued bobbing her head on Dr. Wilcox; this was no longer a coordination challenge for her. The hard part was keeping her mind straight as she began to come for the first time. She moaned and her lips tightened on Dr. Wilcox, and she leaned forward to take him deeper as she came. What are they talking about now?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve passed golf,&amp;quot; Dr. Wilcox said. Or was it &amp;quot;gulf&amp;quot;? Then something about a &amp;quot;hotel&amp;quot;. Hannah strained to listen, but lost focus as she came again and moaned loudly. Stanley paused and chuckled, presumably at her, and her eyes tightened with humiliation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stanley said something like, &amp;quot;Seven more with Rachel.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wilcox spoke softly in reply and through his cock Hannah felt him reach an arm out to comfort Stanley. Her pussy was dripping onto the grass now and her fingers were a blur. Just as she started coming again, Dr. Wilcox said, &amp;quot;... would be fine. You&amp;#39;ve got all week to meet them.&amp;quot; Hannah moaned again and took Dr. Wilcox to the back of her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stanley paused, hearing her moan again? &amp;quot;What about Hannah?&amp;quot; he asked, and her stomach jumped. Her whole body jumped, and her head hit the table with a thunk, rattling dishes and glassware. It felt like the world went silent, and Hannah&amp;#39;s humiliation was complete. She felt tears pouring from her eyes as she panted on Dr. Wilcox and rubbed herself. Another orgasm crept up on her and her body shuddered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wilcox said, &amp;quot;No, only the graduates. We have a few years left.&amp;quot; Hannah felt his cock suddenly spasm in her mouth and a rush of hot, salty semen flooded her tongue and throat. She was almost dizzy from her own orgasms, but she sucked and slurped to make sure she caught every drop from Dr. Wilcox. She really didn&amp;#39;t want to be switched in front of all these people. She swallowed two mouthfuls of semen and began cleaning the cock with her tongue, but Dr. Wilcox reached down and touched her cheek to stop her. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re dismissed, Hannah,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She crawled out from under the hot table into the cooler air. Her body was drenched with sweat and her own come dripped down her thighs. Her hands were covered in her juices, and her mouth tasted like hot semen. Her nipples hardened as she emerged, and she carefully avoided looking towards Stanley, though he was studying her body intently. Hannah hoped they&amp;#39;d think her skin was red from the heat under the table and not embarrassment. She curtsied towards Dr. Wilcox and scrambled to find her friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Hannah felt refreshed and frisky. She'd slept more than 10 hours and woken before the first rays of sun peeked over the canopy of trees below. The previous day of travel had worn her out and her muscles were still sore, but now it felt good. She had spent the night cuddled up to the warm, soft form of Emily, and wasn't surprised to find that her pussy was wet. When was the last time she had shared a bed with anyone? Probably not since childhood, and never naked. She stretched and reached her arms around the other girl to hold her close. Last night had been... incredible? Sweet and warm? Hannah purred at the memory of Emily's lips on hers, Emily's fingers inside her. She had never thought she'd have sex with another girl, and she wanted to do it again.\n\nEmily felt Hannah's stirring and creaked open her eyes. She smiled when she saw Hannah looking back at her, and snuggled in. \"Good morning,\" she said.\n\nHannah said, \"Good morning. Mrs. Carver said that breakfast won't be served until the sun clears the horizon.\"\n\n\"Do you know where?\" Emily asked. This was the first time for each of them to visit Dr. Wilcox's island.\n\n\"Nooooo,\" Hannah said, gently cupping Emily's breast in her hand. Emily was a B-cup, and her boobs fit nicely into Hannah's hands. \"But I'm sure we have a little time.\" Hannah's tongue peeked out to dance over Emily's nipple.\n\nEmily purred. \"It's not like we have to get dressed or anything,\" she said, and they both giggled.\n\nHannah's hand traced down the curves of Emily's body, remembering their journey the night before. Emily was athletic, and Hannah enjoyed feeling her lithe, muscular body beneath her soft skin. \"Your legs are amazing,\" she said. \"Last night when we were climbing the endless stairs... I was checking out your ass,\" Hannah said, and glided her fingers past Emily's pussy to feel her butt cheeks from between her legs.\n\nEmily squirmed. \"That tickles,\" she laughed. Hannah's fingers firmed up and pressed into Emily's slit, and Emily's laugh turned into a moan. \"I know you were,\" Emily said. \"Why do you think I went up in front of you?\"\n\nHannah laughed and dipped her fingers into Emily's pussy. \"You're naughty.\"\n\nEmily grinned. \"Maybe, but whose fingers are in whose pussy?\" she asked. Hannah curled her fingers inside Emily and rubbed in a gentle circle, and Emily arched her back and pushed down. \"Keep doing that.\"\n\n\"I like it when you say my name,\" Hannah said.\n\n\"Please, my dearest Hannah, please keep rubbing my pussy!\" Emily said.\n\nHannah obliged, and slid her thumb over Emily's clit. She slowly brought Emily to orgasm and reveled in the girl's writhing pleasure. Her orgasm didn't have the fierce urgency of the night before, but Hannah warmed inside as her friend sighed and curled around her arm like a contented kitten.\n\nEmily slowly roused herself, looked out the window at the rising sun, and said, \"Your turn!\" Then she slid under the covers and between Hannah's legs. Hannah's smooth pussy was already really wet, and Emily got a face-full. Hannah intertwined her fingers in Emily's curly blonde hair and sighed as Emily's lips and tongue explored her pussy. Emily's tongue felt small and soft as it traced the edges of Hannah's pussy lips and teased her clit. After playing for a while, Emily wrapped her lips around Hannah's clit and began to lick in earnest. The focused attention quickly pushed Hannah over the edge. Her thighs squeezed Emily's head and her fingers pulled her hair as she came with a loud cry. Emily didn't relent, but as Hannah's quivering subsided she began to lick more slowly, in long strokes, lapping up Hannah's juices.\n\nHannah was grinning from ear to ear when Emily's head popped back out. She pulled the other girl up to lay on top of her and kissed her face, from forehead to chin and all around, finishing tenderly on her lips. \"You're amazing, Emily,\" she said. Emily sighed and laid her head on Hannah's breasts and the two girls snuggled just a little longer.\n\n\"You may have already eaten,\" Hannah teased, \"but I'm hungry.\"\n\nEmily laughed. \"Dr. Wilcox will be there,\" she said. \"I definitely need a shower.\"\n\nHannah agreed and they squeezed into the small shower together, washing each other and drying off with the plush white towels. All the toiletries they needed were stocked in the cabinet, but they had no make-up. They dried and and brushed each other's hair: Hannah a brunette, Emily a curly blonde. By the time they were ready the sun was above the trees and shining brightly into their tree-top hideaway.\n\nHannah led the way down the winding staircase that spiraled around the trunk of the massive tree. As they descended through the canopy the sunlight dimmed and the breeze grew still. The squawks and whistles of tropical birds and unknown animals enveloped them, a marked contrast from the roaring screams that periodically tore through the silent forest the night before. Maybe the right word was \"jungle\", but if so, this portion appeared to be tame. The stairs eventually brought them back to the sign at the base of the tree: \"Robinson Tree House\". The path that felt so forbidding last night was well-kept, and a short walk brought the girls to a wider trail.\n\nEmily paused at the intersection. \"Do you think there are... any... men here?\" she asked. They had been naked since arriving, but also mostly alone. The prospect of meeting a bunch of strangers naked was intimidating.\n\n\"I don't know, but I'm hungry,\" Hannah said, and added: \"Dr. Wilcox, for one.\"\n\nEmily took her hand, and Hannah picked the direction that looked most promising: back towards the airstrip they arrived at yesterday. They had walked only a short way when they heard voices ahead and came upon a group of girls emerging from a round green door set into an embankment along the path. Emily's grip tightened. \n\n\"Oh. My. Gosh,\" Hannah said. \"You've got to be kidding.\"\n\nA sign near the door said, \"Bag End\".\n\nHannah released Emily's hand and hurried forward, oblivious to the three naked girls who had just emerged from the hole. She bent over to examine the door and squealed with glee. \"Look, it even has Gandalf's rune!\"\n\nThe three girls looked at Hannah uncertainly, and then at Emily. There were two brunettes and a blonde, all beautiful, of course. The blonde was a bit taller than the other two and frowned at Hannah's behavior. \"Get a grip,\" she said. \"It's a door.\" The two brunettes with her giggled.\n\nHannah straightened up and said, \"It's from 'Lord of the Rings'. Did you sleep in there last night?\"\n\nThe blonde said, \"Yep. I didn't see those movies. Not really my thing. There are all sorts of rooms along the path. You never know what you're going to get when you visit.\" She looked up and down the path.\n\nHannah blushed and shrugged. \"They're books. I'm Hannah, and this is Emily. We stayed in the tree house.\" Emily waved.\n\nThe blonde said, \"I'm Nicole.\"\n\nOne of the brunettes, a tiny girl, said, \"I'm Ashley. I knew they were books.\"\n\nThe other brunette said, \"I'm Elizabeth. Nice to meet you. I can show you Bag End later if you want. There are tunnels --\"\n\nNicole cut her off. \"This is your first time here, am I right?\" Hannah and Emily nodded. \"Well, follow us to breakfast.\"\n\nThe group of five girls started walking, led by Nicole. Hannah and Emily were full of questions, but where to start?\n\nNicole had been in their position once. \"Dr. Wilcox brings us here when he has a customer and wants to show us off. Sometimes it's all the girls, sometimes just the graduates,\" Nicole said, finding her way confidently through the trees.\n\nHannah started putting pieces together in her mind. \"So the customer is here to pick out a girl,\" she said. \"To marry.\"\n\nNicole stared at Hannah like she was a bit slow in the head. \"Obviously. One of the graduates. So not any of us. You can tell the graduates because they'll be wearing black chokers.\"\n\n\"So why are the rest of us here?\" Emily asked.\n\nAshley snickered, \"Because Dr. Wilcox likes to fuck a bunch of girls at once?\" Elizabeth giggled and Emily blushed. From what Hannah knew of men, it sounded likely to be true.\n\nNicole said, \"It's more than that. It's part of the training, I think.\"\n\nHannah repeated Mrs. Carver's words from the night before, \"Not everything here is what it seems.\"\n\nNicole stopped the group. They hadn't seen anyone else on the path, but she looked around nervously and leaned in close. \"I trust Dr. Wilcox with my life. Literally. But he isn't telling us the whole story.\" The other girls were silent for a moment, and Nicole started walking again.\n\nThe group walked in silence until they emerged from the trees into a grassy clearing. The the surrounding trees cast shadows in the morning sun that covered the whole clearing, but it was still a lot brighter than the path had been, and the girls shaded their eyes with their hands.\n\n\"Great, we're late,\" Ashley said.\n\nElizabeth looked worried. \"I'm sorry, it's not my fault.\"\n\nThere were almost a dozen large round tables in the clearing, and the setup reminded Hannah of a wedding reception. Each table had eight to ten girls sitting around it, talking and eating. The mood was jovial, like long-lost friends reunited.\n\nAt a table set a little apart from the others Hannah saw Dr. Wilcox wearing a white linen robe. To his left sat Shelly, the pilot from yesterday in a blue sun dress, and to his right was a clean-shaven man in his mid-thirties wearing shorts and a Hawaiian shirt. The other seats at the table were occupied by naked girls wearing black chokers. It was then that Hannah noticed other girls in chokers scattered around... Maybe one in ten.\n\nNone of the breakfasters seemed to pay much notice Hannah and others, but Mrs. Carver appeared next to them out of nowhere. \n\n\"Breakfast is out. Serve yourselves,\" she said. \"Except you, Hannah. Dr. Wilcox told me to send you to him.\"\n\nHannah looked at Emily and shrugged. \"See you soon.\" She glanced at the other girls.

They'd met at one of his parents' parties a few years ago, when his wife Rachel had been pregnant with their first child. What was his name? Stanley? He must have recognized her, too.

There was a warm sticky substance oozing down my temple. Blood. My vision was blurry and I could almost feel my head physically pounding. I looked around and after a few moments I realised where I was. I had been on a flight from Seattle, Washington to visit my sister in England. She lived and worked there. She owned a restaurant. I had no idea why I was thinking about my Sister\u2019s occupation at a time like this, whatever. I quickly came to the conclusion that the plane must have crashed. I undid my seatbelt and tried to stand up only to find my legs were incredibly wobbly. Almost immediately after standing up I felt dizzy, fell to my knees and vomited. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After my frankly disgusting display I managed to stand up on wobbly legs and have a better look around now that my vision wasn\u2019t so blurry. \u201cHello\u2026\u201d I called. My voice surprised me, it was hoarse and rough. It sounded like I had been smoking a pack-a-day for 40 years. I tried to clear my throat. \u201cHello\u2026\u201d I repeated. The difference was barely noticeable. I searched around for any signs of life. On TV they always held two fingers to someone\u2019s neck to check for a pulse, but I wasn\u2019t quite sure how to do it properly and I didn\u2019t fancy touching people who might be dead. \u201cIs anyone\u2026 alive?\u201d When I said alive my stomach turned. I had been thinking it, but actually saying it seemed wrong. I tried again, louder this time \u201cHello\u2026\u201d My voice seemed to be getting better now.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wrongly assuming everyone but me was dead, I started to panic. \u201cOh shit.\u201d I muttered. \u201cWhat the fuck am I going to do. Fuck fuck fuck &lt;strong&gt;FUCK.&lt;/strong&gt;\u201d I shouted the last \u2018Fuck\u2019 My breathing was becoming laboured as I panicked. I leaned against the wall and slid down until I was sitting down, my head in my hands.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like this roleplay to be long term and have lots of romance and build up. I\u2019m pretty open to most kinks. So just shoot me a message if you want to roleplay!&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Prompt 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;6:45 A.M.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nMy eyes open and I reach for my phone, quickly turning off the alarm as fast as possible. I look over to my left and can\u2019t help but smile. My beautiful kitten, peacefully asleep. I let my legs fall off of the bed and try to stifle a yawn. As I stand up and stretch, I think about the fact that today of all days I have to work. Today was your, my beautiful kitten\u2019s, birthday. I had gotten a half day but there was simply no way I could avoid this meeting I had today. Reaching into the my bedside table drawer, I feel around for the card I wrote you last night.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Kitten,\nI\u2019m so sorry I have to work today. I tried so hard to get out of it, but I simply can\u2019t. I finish today at 12 o\u2019clock and I should be home no later than 12:30. When I get home we can open your presents and I\u2019ve booked a reservation at a restaurant for dinner. Again, I\u2019m so sorry I have to work.&lt;br/&gt;\nHappy Birthday.&lt;br/&gt;\nLove, Sir&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turn it over to confirm the envelope has your name written on the front. I quietly place it next to you on your bedside table before I go to the bathroom to have a shower and get ready for work. 5 minutes later I step out of the shower, dry and ready to get dressed. After I\u2019ve put on a black suit, white shirt along with a deep red tie, I turn to you and can\u2019t help but smile. I lean down and gently kiss your forehead before I leave the house to go to work.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like this roleplay to be long term and to focus on a more \u2018realistic\u2019 dom/sub relationship with heavy petplay influences. I\u2019m also somewhat of a romantic and romance is pretty much required for the roleplay. You can either reply directly to my prompt in character and we can just go naturally from there or we can chat a bit first about kinks/limits and general story directions.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Prompt 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nMy eyes wander up from the worksheet on classical conditioning I was working on towards the clock on the wall. Fuck. It was only 2:46 and the lesson ended at 3:40. I had only been in this hour long lesson for 6 minutes and I already felt like jumping out the window from boredom. Instead I decided to look at my teacher as she graded last week&amp;#39;s paper on Milgram\u2019s 1965 study into obedience which I had failed almost spectacularly. I mean I hadn\u2019t got my grade back yet but I didn\u2019t study at all for it, so I\u2019m pretty sure I got a huge fat zero.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to my teacher, she was absolutely gorgeous, the kind of girl you read about in stories. I was 18, but I guessed she was only about 8 or so years older than me, just finished her teaching degree. I imagined all the dirty, depraved things I would do to her. I almost felt guilty about these thoughts. It was lucky that I was sitting down and I was at a desk, because otherwise, I\u2019m sure everyone would be laughing at my very obvious erection.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about bending her over her desk, one hand holding hers behind her back while the other gripped a bundle of her hair. I thought about forcing my hard cock into her tight little asshole and making her suck me clean after I filled her with my hot cum. I thought about tying her up and making her drink my piss like the dirty little slut that she was. Little did I know, my teacher was quite simply, the opposite of a submissive slut.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re interested send me a message and we can discuss kinks, limits and the general direction and plot of the roleplay. I would definitely prefer for this to be long-term and to have a romance/affection side to it. I want it to focus on introducing me to being a sub, my character would never have even considered it possible for a man to be submissive to a woman sexually. I want you to show him how enjoyable that can be. Also, if your idea for the plot/continuation of the roleplay is along the lines of \u201cOh you\u2019re failing? Come and make it up to me with your mouth.\u201d don\u2019t even bother, that\u2019s cliched and boring.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt 4&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kitten.&amp;quot; I call softly as I step through the door onto the landing. As I begin to pull off my coat and hang it up on the rack near the door, I see your face appear from around the corner. Wearing nothing but a leather collar adorned with the words &amp;#39;Sir&amp;#39;s Kitten&amp;#39; a headband with kitten ears on it, and a tail plug meant to match the colour of your hair, I can&amp;#39;t help but smile when I see you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walk towards you as you crawl towards me, when we reach each other I slowly lower myself into a squatting position and reach out to pet you on the head. My lips are curved into a smile the entire time as you nuzzle against me. My fingers run themselves through your hair before I drag the tips of my fingers down your cheek. Finally after a minute or so of stroking your hair and cheek I stand up from the squatting position and begin to make my way towards the living room where I sit down on the couch. I pat my lap gently. &amp;quot;Come rest your head on Sir&amp;#39;s lap.&amp;quot; My voice is gentle and loving.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think back to how my life had become so amazing. We had been dating for a year and a half with some sessions of petplay. We had talked about you being my kitten full time, but ultimately due to financial restraints, you had had to stay at your job. That is until three week ago when I got a promotion that more than tripled my salary. Almost immediately you gave your two week notice at your job, both of us eagerly anticipating the moment you could become my full time Kitten.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was only your third day as my kitten and you were still getting used to it, but you tried your best to stick to the rules and be a good kitten for me, which made me beam with pride whenever I thought about you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a while we just enjoy the company of one another, your head resting on my lap while my fingers trace gently from your head down the curve of your spine all the way to your tail before lifting my hand and repeating the motion. A few times I stop stroking for a moment to reach down to gently pinch and pull on one of your nipples, watching the way you look slightly startled but don\u2019t object or try to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kitten.&amp;quot; I say still stroking, and I watch as you lift your head from my lap to look at me. &amp;quot;Go fetch me a whiskey from the kitchen.&amp;quot; I pause and drag my fingers down your cheek before I eventually hold your chin gently in my hands, lifting it up slightly so that our eyes lock. &amp;quot;A single ice cube, you have my permission to stand so you can carry it.\u201d I watch as you stand up and quickly walk to the kitchen to prepare my whiskey.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s a good kitten.\u201d I say as you hand me the glass tumbler filled about halfway with a deep amber liquid and a single ice cube. I bring the glass to my lips and take a long, slow sip, letting the liquid flow over my tongue. Between sips I swirl the liquid slowly in the tumbler while my left hand strokes along your spine.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cKitten\u201d I begin again, and your head lifts up again to look at me. \u201cThis is your third day as my kitten and I finally have a day off tomorrow. I think it\u2019s time we established the set of rules that you must follow as my kitten. Is this okay with you? Or would you rather wait till tomorrow to establish the official rules?\u201d The whole time I speak my hands gently tickles along the curve of your spine.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey there! I&amp;#39;m Edward and that&amp;#39;s my prompt. I&amp;#39;d like this to be long term, and if you haven&amp;#39;t already noticed to include heavy pet play aspects. I would also like for your character to be my full time kitten. If this sounds interesting to you, send me a PM and we can discuss specifics of the roleplay: Kinks, limits, that kind of stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quite enjoy some light ageplay in these types of roles with my character being in his early to mid 30s and your character\u2019s age being somewhere around 18-25 years old. Another big aspect for me is a height difference, I like quite short girls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I created a quick floor plan of our house in the roleplay: &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/NUd8TlB\"&gt;http://imgur.com/NUd8TlB&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. I&amp;#39;m a sucker for pale redheads.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt 5&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holy fucking shit.&lt;/em&gt; I thought as my eyes bugged out almost comically from my head.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ten Minutes Earlier&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;God fucking damnit&lt;/em&gt; My heart was pounding as I sprinted after the bus, trying my best to get the driver\u2019s attention so I could actually get home. There was no way, I slowed down and finally stopped as I watched the bus round a corner.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about what I could do, as I breathed heavily, a bead of sweat dripping down my forehead. I knew my mum was working late tonight and I couldn\u2019t think of anyone else who could pick me up. I walked back to the stop and checked the times. &lt;em&gt;Fuck.&lt;/em&gt; The next bus was still an hour and a half away. I dragged my fingers through my hair with an angry expression. I suppose I could go ask Ms. (Your character\u2019s last name here.) if she could take me home. She\u2019s always been nice to me, and I knew she lived pretty close to me, if anything, she could take me closer and I could walk the rest of the way. Otherwise I\u2019d simply have to wait for the next bus, and that would not be enjoyable.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slowly trudged my way back towards the school building, only about 5 minutes from the bus stop. As I arrived at the school building I thought about where you would most likely be. &lt;em&gt;Probably in her classroom, EN6 I think it is?&lt;/em&gt; I think myself, making my way towards the block of English rooms on the west end of the school.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I arrive at the English block I knock lightly on EN6 but get no answer, I can hear a faint noise inside so I tentatively open the door and step inside.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holy fucking shit.&lt;/em&gt; I thought as my eyes bugged out almost comically from my head. There you were with a long, thick lifelike strapon protruding from your hips as you impaled a male student from my class on it. What surprised me even more was the identity of the student whose ass was twitching around your strapon. The typical football jock, cheerleaders loved him, parties every weekend, that sort of guy, Jason I think his name was.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I surveyed the scene before me, Jason was naked with his legs wrapped around your slight frame and he was moaning girlishly as you fucked him with abandon. It was somewhat of a sight to see, the huge football jock at least a foot taller than the petite, bookish English teacher on his back with a huge strapon thrusting in and out of his ass. I realised that the scene had given me a hard on. &lt;em&gt;God damn I\u2019m fucked up.&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself as my I silently tried to adjust my hard on and escape out the door before I got noticed, intending to wait for the bus and masturbate furiously to the mental image when I got home.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey there! I\u2019m Edward and if you\u2019ve gotten this far (No skipping!) it means you must be at least a  little interested in my prompt. There\u2019s potential for this to also be a Futa situation rather than a strapon and I\u2019m honestly open to either. I\u2019d like your role to be quite dominant but there\u2019s also potential for romance and affection in it and I would absolutely love for it to be included. If you\u2019re interested PM me and we can talk about the specifics, don\u2019t just jump right in, I\u2019d like for us to talk about the roleplay beforehand. Hope to see your orange envelope soon!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"**Prompt 1**  \nI woke up. There was a warm sticky substance oozing down my temple. Blood. My vision was blurry and I could almost feel my head physically pounding. I looked around and after a few moments I realised where I was. I had been on a flight from Seattle, Washington to visit my sister in England. She lived and worked there. She owned a restaurant. I had no idea why I was thinking about my Sister\u2019s occupation at a time like this, whatever. I quickly came to the conclusion that the plane must have crashed. I undid my seatbelt and tried to stand up only to find my legs were incredibly wobbly. Almost immediately after standing up I felt dizzy, fell to my knees and vomited. \n \nAfter my frankly disgusting display I managed to stand up on wobbly legs and have a better look around now that my vision wasn\u2019t so blurry. \u201cHello\u2026\u201d I called. My voice surprised me, it was hoarse and rough. It sounded like I had been smoking a pack-a-day for 40 years. I tried to clear my throat. \u201cHello\u2026\u201d I repeated. The difference was barely noticeable. I searched around for any signs of life. On TV they always held two fingers to someone\u2019s neck to check for a pulse, but I wasn\u2019t quite sure how to do it properly and I didn\u2019t fancy touching people who might be dead. \u201cIs anyone\u2026 alive?\u201d When I said alive my stomach turned. I had been thinking it, but actually saying it seemed wrong. I tried again, louder this time \u201cHello\u2026\u201d My voice seemed to be getting better now.  \n\nWrongly assuming everyone but me was dead, I started to panic. \u201cOh shit.\u201d I muttered. \u201cWhat the fuck am I going to do. Fuck fuck fuck **FUCK.**\u201d I shouted the last \u2018Fuck\u2019 My breathing was becoming laboured as I panicked. I leaned against the wall and slid down until I was sitting down, my head in my hands.  \n  \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI would like this roleplay to be long term and have lots of romance and build up. I\u2019m pretty open to most kinks. So just shoot me a message if you want to roleplay!  \n**Prompt 2**  \n**6:45 A.M.**  \n*Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.*  \nMy eyes open and I reach for my phone, quickly turning off the alarm as fast as possible. I look over to my left and can\u2019t help but smile. My beautiful kitten, peacefully asleep. I let my legs fall off of the bed and try to stifle a yawn. As I stand up and stretch, I think about the fact that today of all days I have to work. Today was your, my beautiful kitten\u2019s, birthday. I had gotten a half day but there was simply no way I could avoid this meeting I had today. Reaching into the my bedside table drawer, I feel around for the card I wrote you last night.  \n\n*Dear Kitten,\nI\u2019m so sorry I have to work today. I tried so hard to get out of it, but I simply can\u2019t. I finish today at 12 o\u2019clock and I should be home no later than 12:30. When I get home we can open your presents and I\u2019ve booked a reservation at a restaurant for dinner. Again, I\u2019m so sorry I have to work.  \nHappy Birthday.  \nLove, Sir*  \n\nI turn it over to confirm the envelope has your name written on the front. I quietly place it next to you on your bedside table before I go to the bathroom to have a shower and get ready for work. 5 minutes later I step out of the shower, dry and ready to get dressed. After I\u2019ve put on a black suit, white shirt along with a deep red tie, I turn to you and can\u2019t help but smile. I lean down and gently kiss your forehead before I leave the house to go to work.  \n  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI would like this roleplay to be long term and to focus on a more \u2018realistic\u2019 dom/sub relationship with heavy petplay influences. I\u2019m also somewhat of a romantic and romance is pretty much required for the roleplay. You can either reply directly to my prompt in character and we can just go naturally from there or we can chat a bit first about kinks/limits and general story directions.  \n**Prompt 3**  \nMy eyes wander up from the worksheet on classical conditioning I was working on towards the clock on the wall. Fuck. It was only 2:46 and the lesson ended at 3:40. I had only been in this hour long lesson for 6 minutes and I already felt like jumping out the window from boredom. Instead I decided to look at my teacher as she graded last week's paper on Milgram\u2019s 1965 study into obedience which I had failed almost spectacularly. I mean I hadn\u2019t got my grade back yet but I didn\u2019t study at all for it, so I\u2019m pretty sure I got a huge fat zero.  \n\nAnyway, back to my teacher, she was absolutely gorgeous, the kind of girl you read about in stories. I was 18, but I guessed she was only about 8 or so years older than me, just finished her teaching degree. I imagined all the dirty, depraved things I would do to her. I almost felt guilty about these thoughts. It was lucky that I was sitting down and I was at a desk, because otherwise, I\u2019m sure everyone would be laughing at my very obvious erection.  \n\nI thought about bending her over her desk, one hand holding hers behind her back while the other gripped a bundle of her hair. I thought about forcing my hard cock into her tight little asshole and making her suck me clean after I filled her with my hot cum. I thought about tying her up and making her drink my piss like the dirty little slut that she was. Little did I know, my teacher was quite simply, the opposite of a submissive slut.  \n  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you\u2019re interested send me a message and we can discuss kinks, limits and the general direction and plot of the roleplay. I would definitely prefer for this to be long-term and to have a romance/affection side to it. I want it to focus on introducing me to being a sub, my character would never have even considered it possible for a man to be submissive to a woman sexually. I want you to show him how enjoyable that can be. Also, if your idea for the plot/continuation of the roleplay is along the lines of \u201cOh you\u2019re failing? Come and make it up to me with your mouth.\u201d don\u2019t even bother, that\u2019s cliched and boring.  \n  \n------------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n**Prompt 4**  \n  \n\"Kitten.\" I call softly as I step through the door onto the landing. As I begin to pull off my coat and hang it up on the rack near the door, I see your face appear from around the corner.

It&amp;#39;s a mix they have all of the real pets then they have the human version. When you step inside the store you notice it smells like vanilla/mint ice cream. You stroll past the cages of normal animals and see a few cats but none catch your eye. You ask the clerk where the human pets are. He points at the very back of the store. You grab a basket and place a collar,leash,toys,candy,and food in there as you make your way back. You reach the back of the store to find glass cages each of which have two bowls a filthy blanket and a human inside you go for the human cats because they are usually calm and sweet. You see four cages the first three you can see straight through without problem then you reach my cage.

It's a mix they have all of the real pets then they have the human version. When you step inside the store you notice it smells like vanilla/mint ice cream. You stroll past the cages of normal animals and see a few cats but none catch your eye. You ask the clerk where the human pets are. He points at the very back of the store. You grab a basket and place a collar,leash,toys,candy,and food in there as you make your way back. You reach the back of the store to find glass cages each of which have two bowls a filthy blanket and a human inside you go for the human cats because they are usually calm and sweet. You see four cages the first three you can see straight through without problem then you reach my cage.

She'd make a great solo cat, but will be fine with a mellow buddy.","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"494snz","from_kind":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"cm17824n","media":null,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/mmJk77p0knjkerUcq_F_Px2AUwfK1ZmQ6-5_BT08CLY.jpg?s=64ac2d900092ff97b348a318307ddf6b","width":600,"height":315},"resolutions":[{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/mmJk77p0knjkerUcq_F_Px2AUwfK1ZmQ6-5_BT08CLY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=96d196a2650431acfa3c0cc3dbd35852","width":108,"height":56},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/mmJk77p0knjkerUcq_F_Px2AUwfK1ZmQ6-5_BT08CLY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=68939dbc44b8c8eb993a796c2377f7cc","width":216,"height":113},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/mmJk77p0knjkerUcq_F_Px2AUwfK1ZmQ6-5_BT08CLY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=918145acae28f8a805c18df4b2e703a0","width":320,"height":168}],"variants":{},"id":"R9vnDY03MXg8hPwEJhJKTj6KsBTD4TpuSyE-Bj9dk6I"}]},"num_comments":0,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_2rd9x","hide_score":true,"edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"removal_reason":null,"post_hint":"self","stickied":false,"from":null,"is_self":true,"from_id":null,"permalink":"/r/orangecounty/comments/494snz/looking_to_rehome_kitten/?ref=search_posts","locked":false,"name":"t3_494snz","created":1457249670,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/494snz/looking_to_rehome_kitten/","author_flair_text":null,"quarantine":false,"title":"Looking to re-home kitten","created_utc":1457220870,"distinguished":null,"mod_reports":[],"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"ups":1}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"domain":"youtu.be","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{"content":"&lt;iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F4T4_8LnvXw8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4T4_8LnvXw8%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F4T4_8LnvXw8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=2aa3c4d5f3de4f5b9120b660ad850dc9&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;","width":600,"scrolling":false,"height":338},"subreddit":"catvideos","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":{"type":"youtu.be","oembed":{"provider_url":"https://www.youtube.com/","description":"I found this stray kitten at work.

He had some very slight medical issues in the beginning - two bouts with tapeworms and a lump behind his right shoulder.  My vet, whom I love very much, gave him great care and did a biopsy to calm my fears regarding the shoulder.  She didn&amp;#39;t find any cancer cells and we assumed that it had been caused by vaccinations from elsewhere that had been given in the wrong spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve carefully monitored the small lump, which felt somewhat solid, but never seemed to grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up about an hour ago and he met me in the bathroom.

SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah felt refreshed and frisky. She&amp;#39;d slept more than 10 hours and woken before the first rays of sun peeked over the canopy of trees below. The previous day of travel had worn her out and her muscles were still sore, but now it felt good. She had spent the night cuddled up to the warm, soft form of Emily, and wasn&amp;#39;t surprised to find that her pussy was wet. When was the last time she had shared a bed with anyone? Probably not since childhood, and never naked. She stretched and reached her arms around the other girl to hold her close. Last night had been... incredible? Sweet and warm? Hannah purred at the memory of Emily&amp;#39;s lips on hers, Emily&amp;#39;s fingers inside her. She had never thought she&amp;#39;d have sex with another girl, and she wanted to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily felt Hannah&amp;#39;s stirring and creaked open her eyes. She smiled when she saw Hannah looking back at her, and snuggled in. &amp;quot;Good morning,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah said, &amp;quot;Good morning. Mrs. Carver said that breakfast won&amp;#39;t be served until the sun clears the horizon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you know where?&amp;quot; Emily asked. This was the first time for each of them to visit Dr. Wilcox&amp;#39;s island.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nooooo,&amp;quot; Hannah said, gently cupping Emily&amp;#39;s breast in her hand. Emily was a B-cup, and her boobs fit nicely into Hannah&amp;#39;s hands. &amp;quot;But I&amp;#39;m sure we have a little time.&amp;quot; Hannah&amp;#39;s tongue peeked out to dance over Emily&amp;#39;s nipple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily purred. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not like we have to get dressed or anything,&amp;quot; she said, and they both giggled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah&amp;#39;s hand traced down the curves of Emily&amp;#39;s body, remembering their journey the night before. Emily was athletic, and Hannah enjoyed feeling her lithe, muscular body beneath her soft skin. &amp;quot;Your legs are amazing,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Last night when we were climbing the endless stairs... I was checking out your ass,&amp;quot; Hannah said, and glided her fingers past Emily&amp;#39;s pussy to feel her butt cheeks from between her legs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily squirmed. &amp;quot;That tickles,&amp;quot; she laughed. Hannah&amp;#39;s fingers firmed up and pressed into Emily&amp;#39;s slit, and Emily&amp;#39;s laugh turned into a moan. &amp;quot;I know you were,&amp;quot; Emily said. &amp;quot;Why do you think I went up in front of you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah laughed and dipped her fingers into Emily&amp;#39;s pussy. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re naughty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily grinned. &amp;quot;Maybe, but whose fingers are in whose pussy?&amp;quot; she asked. Hannah curled her fingers inside Emily and rubbed in a gentle circle, and Emily arched her back and pushed down. &amp;quot;Keep doing that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I like it when you say my name,&amp;quot; Hannah said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please, my dearest Hannah, please keep rubbing my pussy!&amp;quot; Emily said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah obliged, and slid her thumb over Emily&amp;#39;s clit. She slowly brought Emily to orgasm and reveled in the girl&amp;#39;s writhing pleasure. Her orgasm didn&amp;#39;t have the fierce urgency of the night before, but Hannah warmed inside as her friend sighed and curled around her arm like a contented kitten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily slowly roused herself, looked out the window at the rising sun, and said, &amp;quot;Your turn!&amp;quot; Then she slid under the covers and between Hannah&amp;#39;s legs. Hannah&amp;#39;s smooth pussy was already really wet, and Emily got a face-full. Hannah intertwined her fingers in Emily&amp;#39;s curly blonde hair and sighed as Emily&amp;#39;s lips and tongue explored her pussy. Emily&amp;#39;s tongue felt small and soft as it traced the edges of Hannah&amp;#39;s pussy lips and teased her clit. After playing for a while, Emily wrapped her lips around Hannah&amp;#39;s clit and began to lick in earnest. The focused attention quickly pushed Hannah over the edge. Her thighs squeezed Emily&amp;#39;s head and her fingers pulled her hair as she came with a loud cry. Emily didn&amp;#39;t relent, but as Hannah&amp;#39;s quivering subsided she began to lick more slowly, in long strokes, lapping up Hannah&amp;#39;s juices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah was grinning from ear to ear when Emily&amp;#39;s head popped back out. She pulled the other girl up to lay on top of her and kissed her face, from forehead to chin and all around, finishing tenderly on her lips. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re amazing, Emily,&amp;quot; she said. Emily sighed and laid her head on Hannah&amp;#39;s breasts and the two girls snuggled just a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You may have already eaten,&amp;quot; Hannah teased, &amp;quot;but I&amp;#39;m hungry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily laughed. &amp;quot;Dr. Wilcox will be there,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;I definitely need a shower.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah agreed and they squeezed into the small shower together, washing each other and drying off with the plush white towels. All the toiletries they needed were stocked in the cabinet, but they had no make-up. They dried and and brushed each other&amp;#39;s hair: Hannah a brunette, Emily a curly blonde. By the time they were ready the sun was above the trees and shining brightly into their tree-top hideaway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah led the way down the winding staircase that spiraled around the trunk of the massive tree. As they descended through the canopy the sunlight dimmed and the breeze grew still. The squawks and whistles of tropical birds and unknown animals enveloped them, a marked contrast from the roaring screams that periodically tore through the silent forest the night before. Maybe the right word was &amp;quot;jungle&amp;quot;, but if so, this portion appeared to be tame. The stairs eventually brought them back to the sign at the base of the tree: &amp;quot;Robinson Tree House&amp;quot;. The path that felt so forbidding last night was well-kept, and a short walk brought the girls to a wider trail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily paused at the intersection. &amp;quot;Do you think there are... any... men here?&amp;quot; she asked. They had been naked since arriving, but also mostly alone. The prospect of meeting a bunch of strangers naked was intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know, but I&amp;#39;m hungry,&amp;quot; Hannah said, and added: &amp;quot;Dr. Wilcox, for one.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily took her hand, and Hannah picked the direction that looked most promising: back towards the airstrip they arrived at yesterday. They had walked only a short way when they heard voices ahead and came upon a group of girls emerging from a round green door set into an embankment along the path. Emily&amp;#39;s grip tightened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh. My. Gosh,&amp;quot; Hannah said. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve got to be kidding.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A sign near the door said, &amp;quot;Bag End&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah released Emily&amp;#39;s hand and hurried forward, oblivious to the three naked girls who had just emerged from the hole. She bent over to examine the door and squealed with glee. &amp;quot;Look, it even has Gandalf&amp;#39;s rune!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The three girls looked at Hannah uncertainly, and then at Emily. There were two brunettes and a blonde, all beautiful, of course. The blonde was a bit taller than the other two and frowned at Hannah&amp;#39;s behavior. &amp;quot;Get a grip,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a door.&amp;quot; The two brunettes with her giggled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah straightened up and said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s from &amp;#39;Lord of the Rings&amp;#39;. Did you sleep in there last night?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The blonde said, &amp;quot;Yep. I didn&amp;#39;t see those movies. Not really my thing. There are all sorts of rooms along the path. You never know what you&amp;#39;re going to get when you visit.&amp;quot; She looked up and down the path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah blushed and shrugged. &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re books. I&amp;#39;m Hannah, and this is Emily. We stayed in the tree house.&amp;quot; Emily waved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The blonde said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m Nicole.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the brunettes, a tiny girl, said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m Ashley. I knew they were books.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other brunette said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m Elizabeth. Nice to meet you. I can show you Bag End later if you want. There are tunnels --&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nicole cut her off. &amp;quot;This is your first time here, am I right?&amp;quot; Hannah and Emily nodded. &amp;quot;Well, follow us to breakfast.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The group of five girls started walking, led by Nicole. Hannah and Emily were full of questions, but where to start?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nicole had been in their position once. &amp;quot;Dr. Wilcox brings us here when he has a customer and wants to show us off. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s all the girls, sometimes just the graduates,&amp;quot; Nicole said, finding her way confidently through the trees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah started putting pieces together in her mind. &amp;quot;So the customer is here to pick out a girl,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;To marry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nicole stared at Hannah like she was a bit slow in the head. &amp;quot;Obviously. One of the graduates. So not any of us. You can tell the graduates because they&amp;#39;ll be wearing black chokers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So why are the rest of us here?&amp;quot; Emily asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley snickered, &amp;quot;Because Dr. Wilcox likes to fuck a bunch of girls at once?&amp;quot; Elizabeth giggled and Emily blushed. From what Hannah knew of men, it sounded likely to be true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nicole said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s more than that. It&amp;#39;s part of the training, I think.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah repeated Mrs. Carver&amp;#39;s words from the night before, &amp;quot;Not everything here is what it seems.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nicole stopped the group. They hadn&amp;#39;t seen anyone else on the path, but she looked around nervously and leaned in close. &amp;quot;I trust Dr. Wilcox with my life. Literally. But he isn&amp;#39;t telling us the whole story.&amp;quot; The other girls were silent for a moment, and Nicole started walking again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The group walked in silence until they emerged from the trees into a grassy clearing. The the surrounding trees cast shadows in the morning sun that covered the whole clearing, but it was still a lot brighter than the path had been, and the girls shaded their eyes with their hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Great, we&amp;#39;re late,&amp;quot; Ashley said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth looked worried. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, it&amp;#39;s not my fault.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were almost a dozen large round tables in the clearing, and the setup reminded Hannah of a wedding reception. Each table had eight to ten girls sitting around it, talking and eating. The mood was jovial, like long-lost friends reunited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At a table set a little apart from the others Hannah saw Dr. Wilcox wearing a white linen robe. To his left sat Shelly, the pilot from yesterday in a blue sun dress, and to his right was a clean-shaven man in his mid-thirties wearing shorts and a Hawaiian shirt. The other seats at the table were occupied by naked girls wearing black chokers. It was then that Hannah noticed other girls in chokers scattered around... Maybe one in ten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of the breakfasters seemed to pay much notice Hannah and others, but Mrs. Carver appeared next to them out of nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Breakfast is out. Serve yourselves,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Except you, Hannah. Dr. Wilcox told me to send you to him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah looked at Emily and shrugged. &amp;quot;See you soon.&amp;quot; She glanced at the other girls. Ashley and Elizabeth were looking for seats, but Nicole met her eyes and reached up to touch her own ear. Listen?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah made hey way between the tables; the grass was wet with dew and some stuck to her feet. It smelled freshly mowed. Why weren&amp;#39;t there any bugs in it? Or anywhere? She felt dozens of eyes on her as she walked naked through the crowd of strangers and her skin reddened, but she refused to cover herself in embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Hannah approached the table Shelly turned her ever-present smile on her, but no one else noticed her. What was the protocol? Hannah had no desire to be switched in front of all these people. Dr. Wilcox and the other man were deep in conversation with one of the graduates. Hannah decided to play it safe: she knelt and assumed her patience position behind and to the side of Dr. Wilcox and waited patiently. Her butt on her heels, her knees spread, her back arched to push her breasts forward, and her arms behind her back gripping her elbows. The wet grass tickled her pussy and made her wiggle a little, and as she struggled to maintain position she noticed for the first time another girl under the table... Sucking Dr. Wilcox&amp;#39;s cock!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah must have made some involuntarily noise of surprise, because it was right then that Dr. Wilcox turned to her. &amp;quot;Hannah, relieve Abigail, she needs some breakfast,&amp;quot; he said, and gestured under the table. The girl, Abigail, slowly lifted her head off of Dr. Wilcox and heaved a deep breath. His cock was hugely erect and dripping wet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abigail deftly crawled out from under the table and licked her lips, then smiled at Hannah. She was tan and blonde with amazing d-cups and an ass to match. She curtsied towards Dr. Wilcox. &amp;quot;All yours,&amp;quot; she whispered to Hannah, and walked off to find a seat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The conversations at the table hadn&amp;#39;t stopped. Hannah crawled forward from her patience position and saw the strange man looking down at her. He looked surprised for a moment, then looked away. Hannah slid between Shelly and Dr. Wilcox and under the table. What was that look for? Did they know each other? Her face burned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah moved between Dr. Wilcox&amp;#39;s legs and approached his penis. She had grown very familiar with it over the past few months of training, having spent many hours with it in her mouth and pussy. Dr. Wilcox said that sucking cock was a primal, cathartic comfort for many girls, and that had certainly proven to be true for Hannah. The first time she had sucked him she had cried like a baby. As she leaned forward and took his warm thickness into her mouth she felt a wave of comfort wash over her, even in this strange environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As she sucked, the conversation above her was muffled by the table and cloth, but she could make out bits and pieces. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s been a over a year,&amp;quot; Dr. Wilcox said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s time. It&amp;#39;s part of the agreement.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other man mumbled something that Hannah couldn&amp;#39;t make out, and then Shelly said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;ll be good for your kids, too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man said something about &amp;quot;Rachel&amp;quot;, and that&amp;#39;s when recognition hit Hannah: she did know this man! They&amp;#39;d met at one of his parents&amp;#39; parties a few years ago, when his wife Rachel had been pregnant with their first child. What was his name? Stanley? He must have recognized her, too. What was going on here? Hannah kept sucking on Dr. Wilcox while her mind whirred.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Girls, you&amp;#39;re dismissed,&amp;quot; Dr. Wilcox said loudly, and the girls at the table immediately started rising to leave. &amp;quot;Not you, Hannah,&amp;quot; he continued. &amp;quot;Rub your pussy while you suck. Keep coming.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, sir,&amp;quot; Hannah mumbled, though who knows if he heard it with a cock in her mouth from under the table. They&amp;#39;d played this game before, training her to orgasm quickly and easily, over and over, while sucking dick. It was usually a lot of fun, but Hannah would have a hard time eavesdropping. She began to rub her clit with her right hand and continued bobbing her head on Dr. Wilcox; this was no longer a coordination challenge for her. The hard part was keeping her mind straight as she began to come for the first time. She moaned and her lips tightened on Dr. Wilcox, and she leaned forward to take him deeper as she came. What are they talking about now?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve passed golf,&amp;quot; Dr. Wilcox said. Or was it &amp;quot;gulf&amp;quot;? Then something about a &amp;quot;hotel&amp;quot;. Hannah strained to listen, but lost focus as she came again and moaned loudly. Stanley paused and chuckled, presumably at her, and her eyes tightened with humiliation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stanley said something like, &amp;quot;Seven more with Rachel.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wilcox spoke softly in reply and through his cock Hannah felt him reach an arm out to comfort Stanley. Her pussy was dripping onto the grass now and her fingers were a blur. Just as she started coming again, Dr. Wilcox said, &amp;quot;... would be fine. You&amp;#39;ve got all week to meet them.&amp;quot; Hannah moaned again and took Dr. Wilcox to the back of her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stanley paused, hearing her moan again? &amp;quot;What about Hannah?&amp;quot; he asked, and her stomach jumped. Her whole body jumped, and her head hit the table with a thunk, rattling dishes and glassware. It felt like the world went silent, and Hannah&amp;#39;s humiliation was complete. She felt tears pouring from her eyes as she panted on Dr. Wilcox and rubbed herself. Another orgasm crept up on her and her body shuddered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wilcox said, &amp;quot;No, only the graduates. We have a few years left.&amp;quot; Hannah felt his cock suddenly spasm in her mouth and a rush of hot, salty semen flooded her tongue and throat. She was almost dizzy from her own orgasms, but she sucked and slurped to make sure she caught every drop from Dr. Wilcox. She really didn&amp;#39;t want to be switched in front of all these people. She swallowed two mouthfuls of semen and began cleaning the cock with her tongue, but Dr. Wilcox reached down and touched her cheek to stop her. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re dismissed, Hannah,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She crawled out from under the hot table into the cooler air. Her body was drenched with sweat and her own come dripped down her thighs. Her hands were covered in her juices, and her mouth tasted like hot semen. Her nipples hardened as she emerged, and she carefully avoided looking towards Stanley, though he was studying her body intently. Hannah hoped they&amp;#39;d think her skin was red from the heat under the table and not embarrassment. She curtsied towards Dr. Wilcox and scrambled to find her friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Hannah felt refreshed and frisky. She'd slept more than 10 hours and woken before the first rays of sun peeked over the canopy of trees below. The previous day of travel had worn her out and her muscles were still sore, but now it felt good. She had spent the night cuddled up to the warm, soft form of Emily, and wasn't surprised to find that her pussy was wet. When was the last time she had shared a bed with anyone? Probably not since childhood, and never naked. She stretched and reached her arms around the other girl to hold her close. Last night had been... incredible? Sweet and warm? Hannah purred at the memory of Emily's lips on hers, Emily's fingers inside her. She had never thought she'd have sex with another girl, and she wanted to do it again.\n\nEmily felt Hannah's stirring and creaked open her eyes. She smiled when she saw Hannah looking back at her, and snuggled in. \"Good morning,\" she said.\n\nHannah said, \"Good morning. Mrs. Carver said that breakfast won't be served until the sun clears the horizon.\"\n\n\"Do you know where?\" Emily asked. This was the first time for each of them to visit Dr. Wilcox's island.\n\n\"Nooooo,\" Hannah said, gently cupping Emily's breast in her hand. Emily was a B-cup, and her boobs fit nicely into Hannah's hands. \"But I'm sure we have a little time.\" Hannah's tongue peeked out to dance over Emily's nipple.\n\nEmily purred. \"It's not like we have to get dressed or anything,\" she said, and they both giggled.\n\nHannah's hand traced down the curves of Emily's body, remembering their journey the night before. Emily was athletic, and Hannah enjoyed feeling her lithe, muscular body beneath her soft skin. \"Your legs are amazing,\" she said. \"Last night when we were climbing the endless stairs... I was checking out your ass,\" Hannah said, and glided her fingers past Emily's pussy to feel her butt cheeks from between her legs.\n\nEmily squirmed. \"That tickles,\" she laughed. Hannah's fingers firmed up and pressed into Emily's slit, and Emily's laugh turned into a moan. \"I know you were,\" Emily said. \"Why do you think I went up in front of you?\"\n\nHannah laughed and dipped her fingers into Emily's pussy. \"You're naughty.\"\n\nEmily grinned. \"Maybe, but whose fingers are in whose pussy?\" she asked. Hannah curled her fingers inside Emily and rubbed in a gentle circle, and Emily arched her back and pushed down. \"Keep doing that.\"\n\n\"I like it when you say my name,\" Hannah said.\n\n\"Please, my dearest Hannah, please keep rubbing my pussy!\" Emily said.\n\nHannah obliged, and slid her thumb over Emily's clit. She slowly brought Emily to orgasm and reveled in the girl's writhing pleasure. Her orgasm didn't have the fierce urgency of the night before, but Hannah warmed inside as her friend sighed and curled around her arm like a contented kitten.\n\nEmily slowly roused herself, looked out the window at the rising sun, and said, \"Your turn!\" Then she slid under the covers and between Hannah's legs. Hannah's smooth pussy was already really wet, and Emily got a face-full. Hannah intertwined her fingers in Emily's curly blonde hair and sighed as Emily's lips and tongue explored her pussy. Emily's tongue felt small and soft as it traced the edges of Hannah's pussy lips and teased her clit. After playing for a while, Emily wrapped her lips around Hannah's clit and began to lick in earnest. The focused attention quickly pushed Hannah over the edge. Her thighs squeezed Emily's head and her fingers pulled her hair as she came with a loud cry. Emily didn't relent, but as Hannah's quivering subsided she began to lick more slowly, in long strokes, lapping up Hannah's juices.\n\nHannah was grinning from ear to ear when Emily's head popped back out. She pulled the other girl up to lay on top of her and kissed her face, from forehead to chin and all around, finishing tenderly on her lips. \"You're amazing, Emily,\" she said. Emily sighed and laid her head on Hannah's breasts and the two girls snuggled just a little longer.\n\n\"You may have already eaten,\" Hannah teased, \"but I'm hungry.\"\n\nEmily laughed. \"Dr. Wilcox will be there,\" she said. \"I definitely need a shower.\"\n\nHannah agreed and they squeezed into the small shower together, washing each other and drying off with the plush white towels. All the toiletries they needed were stocked in the cabinet, but they had no make-up. They dried and and brushed each other's hair: Hannah a brunette, Emily a curly blonde. By the time they were ready the sun was above the trees and shining brightly into their tree-top hideaway.\n\nHannah led the way down the winding staircase that spiraled around the trunk of the massive tree. As they descended through the canopy the sunlight dimmed and the breeze grew still. The squawks and whistles of tropical birds and unknown animals enveloped them, a marked contrast from the roaring screams that periodically tore through the silent forest the night before. Maybe the right word was \"jungle\", but if so, this portion appeared to be tame. The stairs eventually brought them back to the sign at the base of the tree: \"Robinson Tree House\". The path that felt so forbidding last night was well-kept, and a short walk brought the girls to a wider trail.\n\nEmily paused at the intersection. \"Do you think there are... any... men here?\" she asked. They had been naked since arriving, but also mostly alone. The prospect of meeting a bunch of strangers naked was intimidating.\n\n\"I don't know, but I'm hungry,\" Hannah said, and added: \"Dr. Wilcox, for one.\"\n\nEmily took her hand, and Hannah picked the direction that looked most promising: back towards the airstrip they arrived at yesterday. They had walked only a short way when they heard voices ahead and came upon a group of girls emerging from a round green door set into an embankment along the path. Emily's grip tightened. \n\n\"Oh. My. Gosh,\" Hannah said. \"You've got to be kidding.\"\n\nA sign near the door said, \"Bag End\".\n\nHannah released Emily's hand and hurried forward, oblivious to the three naked girls who had just emerged from the hole. She bent over to examine the door and squealed with glee. \"Look, it even has Gandalf's rune!\"\n\nThe three girls looked at Hannah uncertainly, and then at Emily. There were two brunettes and a blonde, all beautiful, of course. The blonde was a bit taller than the other two and frowned at Hannah's behavior. \"Get a grip,\" she said. \"It's a door.\" The two brunettes with her giggled.\n\nHannah straightened up and said, \"It's from 'Lord of the Rings'. Did you sleep in there last night?\"\n\nThe blonde said, \"Yep. I didn't see those movies. Not really my thing. There are all sorts of rooms along the path. You never know what you're going to get when you visit.\" She looked up and down the path.\n\nHannah blushed and shrugged. \"They're books. I'm Hannah, and this is Emily. We stayed in the tree house.\" Emily waved.\n\nThe blonde said, \"I'm Nicole.\"\n\nOne of the brunettes, a tiny girl, said, \"I'm Ashley. I knew they were books.\"\n\nThe other brunette said, \"I'm Elizabeth. Nice to meet you. I can show you Bag End later if you want. There are tunnels --\"\n\nNicole cut her off. \"This is your first time here, am I right?\" Hannah and Emily nodded. \"Well, follow us to breakfast.\"\n\nThe group of five girls started walking, led by Nicole. Hannah and Emily were full of questions, but where to start?\n\nNicole had been in their position once. \"Dr. Wilcox brings us here when he has a customer and wants to show us off. Sometimes it's all the girls, sometimes just the graduates,\" Nicole said, finding her way confidently through the trees.\n\nHannah started putting pieces together in her mind. \"So the customer is here to pick out a girl,\" she said. \"To marry.\"\n\nNicole stared at Hannah like she was a bit slow in the head. \"Obviously. One of the graduates. So not any of us. You can tell the graduates because they'll be wearing black chokers.\"\n\n\"So why are the rest of us here?\" Emily asked.\n\nAshley snickered, \"Because Dr. Wilcox likes to fuck a bunch of girls at once?\" Elizabeth giggled and Emily blushed. From what Hannah knew of men, it sounded likely to be true.\n\nNicole said, \"It's more than that. It's part of the training, I think.\"\n\nHannah repeated Mrs. Carver's words from the night before, \"Not everything here is what it seems.\"\n\nNicole stopped the group. They hadn't seen anyone else on the path, but she looked around nervously and leaned in close. \"I trust Dr. Wilcox with my life. Literally. But he isn't telling us the whole story.\" The other girls were silent for a moment, and Nicole started walking again.\n\nThe group walked in silence until they emerged from the trees into a grassy clearing. The the surrounding trees cast shadows in the morning sun that covered the whole clearing, but it was still a lot brighter than the path had been, and the girls shaded their eyes with their hands.\n\n\"Great, we're late,\" Ashley said.\n\nElizabeth looked worried. \"I'm sorry, it's not my fault.\"\n\nThere were almost a dozen large round tables in the clearing, and the setup reminded Hannah of a wedding reception. Each table had eight to ten girls sitting around it, talking and eating. The mood was jovial, like long-lost friends reunited.\n\nAt a table set a little apart from the others Hannah saw Dr. Wilcox wearing a white linen robe. To his left sat Shelly, the pilot from yesterday in a blue sun dress, and to his right was a clean-shaven man in his mid-thirties wearing shorts and a Hawaiian shirt. The other seats at the table were occupied by naked girls wearing black chokers. It was then that Hannah noticed other girls in chokers scattered around... Maybe one in ten.\n\nNone of the breakfasters seemed to pay much notice Hannah and others, but Mrs. Carver appeared next to them out of nowhere. \n\n\"Breakfast is out. Serve yourselves,\" she said. \"Except you, Hannah. Dr. Wilcox told me to send you to him.\"\n\nHannah looked at Emily and shrugged. \"See you soon.\" She glanced at the other girls. Ashley and Elizabeth were looking for seats, but Nicole met her eyes and reached up to touch her own ear. Listen?\n\nHannah made hey way between the tables; the grass was wet with dew and some stuck to her feet. It smelled freshly mowed. Why weren't there any bugs in it? Or anywhere? She felt dozens of eyes on her as she walked naked through the crowd of strangers and her skin reddened, but she refused to cover herself in embarrassment.\n\nAs Hannah approached the table Shelly turned her ever-present smile on her, but no one else noticed her. What was the protocol? Hannah had no desire to be switched in front of all these people. Dr. Wilcox and the other man were deep in conversation with one of the graduates. Hannah decided to play it safe: she knelt and assumed her patience position behind and to the side of Dr. Wilcox and waited patiently. Her butt on her heels, her knees spread, her back arched to push her breasts forward, and her arms behind her back gripping her elbows. The wet grass tickled her pussy and made her wiggle a little, and as she struggled to maintain position she noticed for the first time another girl under the table... Sucking Dr. Wilcox's cock!\n\nHannah must have made some involuntarily noise of surprise, because it was right then that Dr. Wilcox turned to her. \"Hannah, relieve Abigail, she needs some breakfast,\" he said, and gestured under the table. The girl, Abigail, slowly lifted her head off of Dr. Wilcox and heaved a deep breath. His cock was hugely erect and dripping wet. \n\nAbigail deftly crawled out from under the table and licked her lips, then smiled at Hannah. She was tan and blonde with amazing d-cups and an ass to match. She curtsied towards Dr. Wilcox. \"All yours,\" she whispered to Hannah, and walked off to find a seat. \n\nThe conversations at the table hadn't stopped. Hannah crawled forward from her patience position and saw the strange man looking down at her. He looked surprised for a moment, then looked away. Hannah slid between Shelly and Dr. Wilcox and under the table. What was that look for? Did they know each other? Her face burned.\n\nHannah moved between Dr. Wilcox's legs and approached his penis. She had grown very familiar with it over the past few months of training, having spent many hours with it in her mouth and pussy. Dr. Wilcox said that sucking cock was a primal, cathartic comfort for many girls, and that had certainly proven to be true for Hannah. The first time she had sucked him she had cried like a baby. As she leaned forward and took his warm thickness into her mouth she felt a wave of comfort wash over her, even in this strange environment.\n\nAs she sucked, the conversation above her was muffled by the table and cloth, but she could make out bits and pieces. \"It's been a over a year,\" Dr. Wilcox said. \"It's time. It's part of the agreement.\"\n\nThe other man mumbled something that Hannah couldn't make out, and then Shelly said, \"It'll be good for your kids, too.\"\n\nThe man said something about \"Rachel\", and that's when recognition hit Hannah: she did know this man! They'd met at one of his parents' parties a few years ago, when his wife Rachel had been pregnant with their first child. What was his name? Stanley? He must have recognized her, too. What was going on here? Hannah kept sucking on Dr. Wilcox while her mind whirred.\n\n\"Girls, you're dismissed,\" Dr. Wilcox said loudly, and the girls at the table immediately started rising to leave. \"Not you, Hannah,\" he continued. \"Rub your pussy while you suck.

Hannah strained to listen, but lost focus as she came again and moaned loudly. Stanley paused and chuckled, presumably at her, and her eyes tightened with humiliation.\n\nStanley said something like, \"Seven more with Rachel.\"\n\nDr. Wilcox spoke softly in reply and through his cock Hannah felt him reach an arm out to comfort Stanley.

There was a warm sticky substance oozing down my temple. Blood. My vision was blurry and I could almost feel my head physically pounding. I looked around and after a few moments I realised where I was. I had been on a flight from Seattle, Washington to visit my sister in England. She lived and worked there. She owned a restaurant. I had no idea why I was thinking about my Sister\u2019s occupation at a time like this, whatever. I quickly came to the conclusion that the plane must have crashed. I undid my seatbelt and tried to stand up only to find my legs were incredibly wobbly. Almost immediately after standing up I felt dizzy, fell to my knees and vomited. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After my frankly disgusting display I managed to stand up on wobbly legs and have a better look around now that my vision wasn\u2019t so blurry. \u201cHello\u2026\u201d I called. My voice surprised me, it was hoarse and rough. It sounded like I had been smoking a pack-a-day for 40 years. I tried to clear my throat. \u201cHello\u2026\u201d I repeated. The difference was barely noticeable. I searched around for any signs of life. On TV they always held two fingers to someone\u2019s neck to check for a pulse, but I wasn\u2019t quite sure how to do it properly and I didn\u2019t fancy touching people who might be dead. \u201cIs anyone\u2026 alive?\u201d When I said alive my stomach turned. I had been thinking it, but actually saying it seemed wrong. I tried again, louder this time \u201cHello\u2026\u201d My voice seemed to be getting better now.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wrongly assuming everyone but me was dead, I started to panic. \u201cOh shit.\u201d I muttered. \u201cWhat the fuck am I going to do. Fuck fuck fuck &lt;strong&gt;FUCK.&lt;/strong&gt;\u201d I shouted the last \u2018Fuck\u2019 My breathing was becoming laboured as I panicked. I leaned against the wall and slid down until I was sitting down, my head in my hands.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like this roleplay to be long term and have lots of romance and build up. I\u2019m pretty open to most kinks. So just shoot me a message if you want to roleplay!&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Prompt 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;6:45 A.M.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nMy eyes open and I reach for my phone, quickly turning off the alarm as fast as possible. I look over to my left and can\u2019t help but smile. My beautiful kitten, peacefully asleep. I let my legs fall off of the bed and try to stifle a yawn. As I stand up and stretch, I think about the fact that today of all days I have to work. Today was your, my beautiful kitten\u2019s, birthday. I had gotten a half day but there was simply no way I could avoid this meeting I had today. Reaching into the my bedside table drawer, I feel around for the card I wrote you last night.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Kitten,\nI\u2019m so sorry I have to work today. I tried so hard to get out of it, but I simply can\u2019t. I finish today at 12 o\u2019clock and I should be home no later than 12:30. When I get home we can open your presents and I\u2019ve booked a reservation at a restaurant for dinner. Again, I\u2019m so sorry I have to work.&lt;br/&gt;\nHappy Birthday.&lt;br/&gt;\nLove, Sir&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turn it over to confirm the envelope has your name written on the front. I quietly place it next to you on your bedside table before I go to the bathroom to have a shower and get ready for work. 5 minutes later I step out of the shower, dry and ready to get dressed. After I\u2019ve put on a black suit, white shirt along with a deep red tie, I turn to you and can\u2019t help but smile. I lean down and gently kiss your forehead before I leave the house to go to work.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like this roleplay to be long term and to focus on a more \u2018realistic\u2019 dom/sub relationship with heavy petplay influences. I\u2019m also somewhat of a romantic and romance is pretty much required for the roleplay. You can either reply directly to my prompt in character and we can just go naturally from there or we can chat a bit first about kinks/limits and general story directions.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Prompt 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nMy eyes wander up from the worksheet on classical conditioning I was working on towards the clock on the wall. Fuck. It was only 2:46 and the lesson ended at 3:40. I had only been in this hour long lesson for 6 minutes and I already felt like jumping out the window from boredom. Instead I decided to look at my teacher as she graded last week&amp;#39;s paper on Milgram\u2019s 1965 study into obedience which I had failed almost spectacularly. I mean I hadn\u2019t got my grade back yet but I didn\u2019t study at all for it, so I\u2019m pretty sure I got a huge fat zero.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to my teacher, she was absolutely gorgeous, the kind of girl you read about in stories. I was 18, but I guessed she was only about 8 or so years older than me, just finished her teaching degree. I imagined all the dirty, depraved things I would do to her. I almost felt guilty about these thoughts. It was lucky that I was sitting down and I was at a desk, because otherwise, I\u2019m sure everyone would be laughing at my very obvious erection.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about bending her over her desk, one hand holding hers behind her back while the other gripped a bundle of her hair. I thought about forcing my hard cock into her tight little asshole and making her suck me clean after I filled her with my hot cum. I thought about tying her up and making her drink my piss like the dirty little slut that she was. Little did I know, my teacher was quite simply, the opposite of a submissive slut.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re interested send me a message and we can discuss kinks, limits and the general direction and plot of the roleplay. I would definitely prefer for this to be long-term and to have a romance/affection side to it. I want it to focus on introducing me to being a sub, my character would never have even considered it possible for a man to be submissive to a woman sexually. I want you to show him how enjoyable that can be. Also, if your idea for the plot/continuation of the roleplay is along the lines of \u201cOh you\u2019re failing? Come and make it up to me with your mouth.\u201d don\u2019t even bother, that\u2019s cliched and boring.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt 4&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kitten.&amp;quot; I call softly as I step through the door onto the landing. As I begin to pull off my coat and hang it up on the rack near the door, I see your face appear from around the corner. Wearing nothing but a leather collar adorned with the words &amp;#39;Sir&amp;#39;s Kitten&amp;#39; a headband with kitten ears on it, and a tail plug meant to match the colour of your hair, I can&amp;#39;t help but smile when I see you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walk towards you as you crawl towards me, when we reach each other I slowly lower myself into a squatting position and reach out to pet you on the head. My lips are curved into a smile the entire time as you nuzzle against me. My fingers run themselves through your hair before I drag the tips of my fingers down your cheek. Finally after a minute or so of stroking your hair and cheek I stand up from the squatting position and begin to make my way towards the living room where I sit down on the couch. I pat my lap gently. &amp;quot;Come rest your head on Sir&amp;#39;s lap.&amp;quot; My voice is gentle and loving.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think back to how my life had become so amazing. We had been dating for a year and a half with some sessions of petplay. We had talked about you being my kitten full time, but ultimately due to financial restraints, you had had to stay at your job. That is until three week ago when I got a promotion that more than tripled my salary. Almost immediately you gave your two week notice at your job, both of us eagerly anticipating the moment you could become my full time Kitten.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was only your third day as my kitten and you were still getting used to it, but you tried your best to stick to the rules and be a good kitten for me, which made me beam with pride whenever I thought about you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a while we just enjoy the company of one another, your head resting on my lap while my fingers trace gently from your head down the curve of your spine all the way to your tail before lifting my hand and repeating the motion. A few times I stop stroking for a moment to reach down to gently pinch and pull on one of your nipples, watching the way you look slightly startled but don\u2019t object or try to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kitten.&amp;quot; I say still stroking, and I watch as you lift your head from my lap to look at me. &amp;quot;Go fetch me a whiskey from the kitchen.&amp;quot; I pause and drag my fingers down your cheek before I eventually hold your chin gently in my hands, lifting it up slightly so that our eyes lock. &amp;quot;A single ice cube, you have my permission to stand so you can carry it.\u201d I watch as you stand up and quickly walk to the kitchen to prepare my whiskey.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s a good kitten.\u201d I say as you hand me the glass tumbler filled about halfway with a deep amber liquid and a single ice cube. I bring the glass to my lips and take a long, slow sip, letting the liquid flow over my tongue. Between sips I swirl the liquid slowly in the tumbler while my left hand strokes along your spine.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cKitten\u201d I begin again, and your head lifts up again to look at me. \u201cThis is your third day as my kitten and I finally have a day off tomorrow. I think it\u2019s time we established the set of rules that you must follow as my kitten. Is this okay with you? Or would you rather wait till tomorrow to establish the official rules?\u201d The whole time I speak my hands gently tickles along the curve of your spine.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey there! I&amp;#39;m Edward and that&amp;#39;s my prompt. I&amp;#39;d like this to be long term, and if you haven&amp;#39;t already noticed to include heavy pet play aspects. I would also like for your character to be my full time kitten. If this sounds interesting to you, send me a PM and we can discuss specifics of the roleplay: Kinks, limits, that kind of stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quite enjoy some light ageplay in these types of roles with my character being in his early to mid 30s and your character\u2019s age being somewhere around 18-25 years old. Another big aspect for me is a height difference, I like quite short girls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I created a quick floor plan of our house in the roleplay: &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/NUd8TlB\"&gt;http://imgur.com/NUd8TlB&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. I&amp;#39;m a sucker for pale redheads.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt 5&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holy fucking shit.&lt;/em&gt; I thought as my eyes bugged out almost comically from my head.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ten Minutes Earlier&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;God fucking damnit&lt;/em&gt; My heart was pounding as I sprinted after the bus, trying my best to get the driver\u2019s attention so I could actually get home. There was no way, I slowed down and finally stopped as I watched the bus round a corner.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about what I could do, as I breathed heavily, a bead of sweat dripping down my forehead. I knew my mum was working late tonight and I couldn\u2019t think of anyone else who could pick me up. I walked back to the stop and checked the times. &lt;em&gt;Fuck.&lt;/em&gt; The next bus was still an hour and a half away. I dragged my fingers through my hair with an angry expression. I suppose I could go ask Ms. (Your character\u2019s last name here.) if she could take me home. She\u2019s always been nice to me, and I knew she lived pretty close to me, if anything, she could take me closer and I could walk the rest of the way. Otherwise I\u2019d simply have to wait for the next bus, and that would not be enjoyable.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slowly trudged my way back towards the school building, only about 5 minutes from the bus stop. As I arrived at the school building I thought about where you would most likely be. &lt;em&gt;Probably in her classroom, EN6 I think it is?&lt;/em&gt; I think myself, making my way towards the block of English rooms on the west end of the school.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I arrive at the English block I knock lightly on EN6 but get no answer, I can hear a faint noise inside so I tentatively open the door and step inside.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holy fucking shit.&lt;/em&gt; I thought as my eyes bugged out almost comically from my head. There you were with a long, thick lifelike strapon protruding from your hips as you impaled a male student from my class on it. What surprised me even more was the identity of the student whose ass was twitching around your strapon. The typical football jock, cheerleaders loved him, parties every weekend, that sort of guy, Jason I think his name was.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I surveyed the scene before me, Jason was naked with his legs wrapped around your slight frame and he was moaning girlishly as you fucked him with abandon. It was somewhat of a sight to see, the huge football jock at least a foot taller than the petite, bookish English teacher on his back with a huge strapon thrusting in and out of his ass. I realised that the scene had given me a hard on. &lt;em&gt;God damn I\u2019m fucked up.&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself as my I silently tried to adjust my hard on and escape out the door before I got noticed, intending to wait for the bus and masturbate furiously to the mental image when I got home.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey there! I\u2019m Edward and if you\u2019ve gotten this far (No skipping!) it means you must be at least a  little interested in my prompt. There\u2019s potential for this to also be a Futa situation rather than a strapon and I\u2019m honestly open to either. I\u2019d like your role to be quite dominant but there\u2019s also potential for romance and affection in it and I would absolutely love for it to be included. If you\u2019re interested PM me and we can talk about the specifics, don\u2019t just jump right in, I\u2019d like for us to talk about the roleplay beforehand. Hope to see your orange envelope soon!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"**Prompt 1**  \nI woke up. There was a warm sticky substance oozing down my temple. Blood. My vision was blurry and I could almost feel my head physically pounding. I looked around and after a few moments I realised where I was. I had been on a flight from Seattle, Washington to visit my sister in England. She lived and worked there. She owned a restaurant. I had no idea why I was thinking about my Sister\u2019s occupation at a time like this, whatever. I quickly came to the conclusion that the plane must have crashed. I undid my seatbelt and tried to stand up only to find my legs were incredibly wobbly. Almost immediately after standing up I felt dizzy, fell to my knees and vomited. \n \nAfter my frankly disgusting display I managed to stand up on wobbly legs and have a better look around now that my vision wasn\u2019t so blurry. \u201cHello\u2026\u201d I called. My voice surprised me, it was hoarse and rough. It sounded like I had been smoking a pack-a-day for 40 years. I tried to clear my throat. \u201cHello\u2026\u201d I repeated. The difference was barely noticeable. I searched around for any signs of life. On TV they always held two fingers to someone\u2019s neck to check for a pulse, but I wasn\u2019t quite sure how to do it properly and I didn\u2019t fancy touching people who might be dead. \u201cIs anyone\u2026 alive?\u201d When I said alive my stomach turned. I had been thinking it, but actually saying it seemed wrong. I tried again, louder this time \u201cHello\u2026\u201d My voice seemed to be getting better now.  \n\nWrongly assuming everyone but me was dead, I started to panic. \u201cOh shit.\u201d I muttered. \u201cWhat the fuck am I going to do. Fuck fuck fuck **FUCK.**\u201d I shouted the last \u2018Fuck\u2019 My breathing was becoming laboured as I panicked. I leaned against the wall and slid down until I was sitting down, my head in my hands.  \n  \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI would like this roleplay to be long term and have lots of romance and build up. I\u2019m pretty open to most kinks. So just shoot me a message if you want to roleplay!  \n**Prompt 2**  \n**6:45 A.M.**  \n*Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.*  \nMy eyes open and I reach for my phone, quickly turning off the alarm as fast as possible. I look over to my left and can\u2019t help but smile. My beautiful kitten, peacefully asleep. I let my legs fall off of the bed and try to stifle a yawn. As I stand up and stretch, I think about the fact that today of all days I have to work. Today was your, my beautiful kitten\u2019s, birthday. I had gotten a half day but there was simply no way I could avoid this meeting I had today. Reaching into the my bedside table drawer, I feel around for the card I wrote you last night.  \n\n*Dear Kitten,\nI\u2019m so sorry I have to work today. I tried so hard to get out of it, but I simply can\u2019t. I finish today at 12 o\u2019clock and I should be home no later than 12:30. When I get home we can open your presents and I\u2019ve booked a reservation at a restaurant for dinner. Again, I\u2019m so sorry I have to work.  \nHappy Birthday.  \nLove, Sir*  \n\nI turn it over to confirm the envelope has your name written on the front. I quietly place it next to you on your bedside table before I go to the bathroom to have a shower and get ready for work. 5 minutes later I step out of the shower, dry and ready to get dressed. After I\u2019ve put on a black suit, white shirt along with a deep red tie, I turn to you and can\u2019t help but smile. I lean down and gently kiss your forehead before I leave the house to go to work.  \n  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI would like this roleplay to be long term and to focus on a more \u2018realistic\u2019 dom/sub relationship with heavy petplay influences. I\u2019m also somewhat of a romantic and romance is pretty much required for the roleplay. You can either reply directly to my prompt in character and we can just go naturally from there or we can chat a bit first about kinks/limits and general story directions.  \n**Prompt 3**  \nMy eyes wander up from the worksheet on classical conditioning I was working on towards the clock on the wall. Fuck. It was only 2:46 and the lesson ended at 3:40. I had only been in this hour long lesson for 6 minutes and I already felt like jumping out the window from boredom. Instead I decided to look at my teacher as she graded last week's paper on Milgram\u2019s 1965 study into obedience which I had failed almost spectacularly. I mean I hadn\u2019t got my grade back yet but I didn\u2019t study at all for it, so I\u2019m pretty sure I got a huge fat zero.  \n\nAnyway, back to my teacher, she was absolutely gorgeous, the kind of girl you read about in stories. I was 18, but I guessed she was only about 8 or so years older than me, just finished her teaching degree. I imagined all the dirty, depraved things I would do to her. I almost felt guilty about these thoughts. It was lucky that I was sitting down and I was at a desk, because otherwise, I\u2019m sure everyone would be laughing at my very obvious erection.  \n\nI thought about bending her over her desk, one hand holding hers behind her back while the other gripped a bundle of her hair. I thought about forcing my hard cock into her tight little asshole and making her suck me clean after I filled her with my hot cum. I thought about tying her up and making her drink my piss like the dirty little slut that she was. Little did I know, my teacher was quite simply, the opposite of a submissive slut.  \n  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you\u2019re interested send me a message and we can discuss kinks, limits and the general direction and plot of the roleplay. I would definitely prefer for this to be long-term and to have a romance/affection side to it. I want it to focus on introducing me to being a sub, my character would never have even considered it possible for a man to be submissive to a woman sexually. I want you to show him how enjoyable that can be. Also, if your idea for the plot/continuation of the roleplay is along the lines of \u201cOh you\u2019re failing? Come and make it up to me with your mouth.\u201d don\u2019t even bother, that\u2019s cliched and boring.  \n  \n------------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n**Prompt 4**  \n  \n\"Kitten.\" I call softly as I step through the door onto the landing. As I begin to pull off my coat and hang it up on the rack near the door, I see your face appear from around the corner.
