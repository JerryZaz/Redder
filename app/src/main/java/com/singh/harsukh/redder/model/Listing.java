We learned via Android Central that &lt;a href=\"http://www.androidcentral.com/google-and-facebook-will-reportedly-file-amicus-briefs-supporting-apple-fight-fbi\"&gt;Google, along with Facebook, would be filing court motions support Apple\u2019s decision to not create an \u201cfbiOS\u201d&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft isn\u2019t porting Android apps to its phones anymore:&lt;/strong&gt; When Microsoft announced its next version of its phone operating system, one of the key points was that they would make it easy and painless for developers to port existing apps for other platforms over to Windows phones. We\u2019ve seen little headway on Project Astoria (the Android side of this porting process), and received confirmation this week that &lt;a href=\"http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-officially-cancels-project-astoria-bridge-porting-android-apps-windows-10-mobile\"&gt;Astoria had been cancelled, and the project to run Android apps on Windows phones were dead&lt;/a&gt;. Some of you might say \u201cMike, why did you include this headline? Nobody cares about Windows phones!\u201d And I agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motorola knew the Nexus 6 was too big, but Google wanted it:&lt;/strong&gt; I mean, at least they\u2019re admitting it, right? Motorola told techradar this week that &lt;a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/us/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/motorola-admits-nexus-6-was-too-big-but-that-s-what-google-wanted-1315647\"&gt;they could have made the Nexus 6 the same size as the Moto X, but Google wanted a phablet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nextbit Robin AMA:&lt;/strong&gt; In case you missed it, we had the Nextbit team on our subreddit this week to answer questions about their flagship phone, the Robin; the phone that should (hypothetically) never run out of storage. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/47e1rl/we_are_nextbit_creators_of_robin_the_cloudfirst/\"&gt;If you missed it, go check it out!&lt;/a&gt; A ton of their team showed up, and they did a great job answering questions everyone put up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversible microUSB cable:&lt;/strong&gt; Listen, nobody believes that we should all be using Type C more than myself, but I\u2019m including this in light of the S7 being a microUSB. &lt;a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/hands-on-with-the-micflip-reversible-cable-the-standard-for-all-microusb-cables/\"&gt;Apparently someone invented a reversible microUSB cord and didn\u2019t tell me?&lt;/a&gt;. It seems to be durable as well as reversible, and in testing the cord support quick charge. It might be too late now that we\u2019re slowly changing USB spec, but if you\u2019re using a phone that still uses microUSB, this cord seems like a solid investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet Mighty, the Spotify iPod Shuffle:&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome to our new segment, \u201cCoolest Announcement of the Week;\u201d it will only ever appear once, but I invented it because this product sounds awesome. Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming services available, and now a company has &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/23/11102010/mighty-spotify-player-ipod-shuffle\"&gt;launched a Kickstarter for a small, iPod Shuffle-style device that works with your Spotify account&lt;/a&gt;. In the interest of full disclosure, I backed this product, because I think this is awesome.

Hope you guys find it useful!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"----\n[**Subscribe to /r/Android Weekly Newsletter**](https://www.pushbullet.com/channel?tag=randroid)  \n\n\n[**Subscribe to e-mail alerts via IFTTT**](https://ifttt.com/recipes/280654-r-android-weekly-newsletter)\n\n\n\n----\n\n**This Week In News**\n\n----\n\n- **Google will support Apple against the FBI:** You don\u2019t have to live on the internet to know that the biggest tech headline of the last week has been the FBI vs. Apple; as we watch this fight for privacy unfold, we\u2019ve learned where various companies stand on the issue. We learned via Android Central that [Google, along with Facebook, would be filing court motions support Apple\u2019s decision to not create an \u201cfbiOS\u201d](http://www.androidcentral.com/google-and-facebook-will-reportedly-file-amicus-briefs-supporting-apple-fight-fbi).\n\n- **Microsoft isn\u2019t porting Android apps to its phones anymore:** When Microsoft announced its next version of its phone operating system, one of the key points was that they would make it easy and painless for developers to port existing apps for other platforms over to Windows phones. We\u2019ve seen little headway on Project Astoria (the Android side of this porting process), and received confirmation this week that [Astoria had been cancelled, and the project to run Android apps on Windows phones were dead](http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-officially-cancels-project-astoria-bridge-porting-android-apps-windows-10-mobile). Some of you might say \u201cMike, why did you include this headline? Nobody cares about Windows phones!\u201d And I agree.\n\n- **Motorola knew the Nexus 6 was too big, but Google wanted it:** I mean, at least they\u2019re admitting it, right? Motorola told techradar this week that [they could have made the Nexus 6 the same size as the Moto X, but Google wanted a phablet](http://www.techradar.com/us/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/motorola-admits-nexus-6-was-too-big-but-that-s-what-google-wanted-1315647).\n\n- **Nextbit Robin AMA:** In case you missed it, we had the Nextbit team on our subreddit this week to answer questions about their flagship phone, the Robin; the phone that should (hypothetically) never run out of storage. [If you missed it, go check it out!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/47e1rl/we_are_nextbit_creators_of_robin_the_cloudfirst/) A ton of their team showed up, and they did a great job answering questions everyone put up.\n\n- **Reversible microUSB cable:** Listen, nobody believes that we should all be using Type C more than myself, but I\u2019m including this in light of the S7 being a microUSB. [Apparently someone invented a reversible microUSB cord and didn\u2019t tell me?](http://www.zdnet.com/article/hands-on-with-the-micflip-reversible-cable-the-standard-for-all-microusb-cables/). It seems to be durable as well as reversible, and in testing the cord support quick charge. It might be too late now that we\u2019re slowly changing USB spec, but if you\u2019re using a phone that still uses microUSB, this cord seems like a solid investment.\n\n- **Meet Mighty, the Spotify iPod Shuffle:** Welcome to our new segment, \u201cCoolest Announcement of the Week;\u201d it will only ever appear once, but I invented it because this product sounds awesome. Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming services available, and now a company has [launched a Kickstarter for a small, iPod Shuffle-style device that works with your Spotify account](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/23/11102010/mighty-spotify-player-ipod-shuffle). In the interest of full disclosure, I backed this product, because I think this is awesome. A link to the Kickstarter campaign can be found in the linked Verge article if you\u2019d like to check out more.\n\n----\n\n**This Week In Apps:** \n\n----\n\n- **Whatsapp is ending support for Froyo and Eclair:** [Upgrade your phone. Please. For me?](https://blog.whatsapp.com/10000617/WhatsApp-support-for-mobile-devices)\n\n- **Boost for reddit releases:** I take great pride in poking the large, burning fire that is the Great Reddit App debate, and I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if I didn\u2019t encourage you to basically try every single reddit app that is ever available. This week, [Boost for reddit officially launched](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/47cq1b/dev_ive_just_released_boost_for_reddit_a_new/). It features the ability to filter what content you\u2019re saving, so you can make sure you\u2019re ONLY SEEING GIFS. REVELATORY FEATURE.\n\n- **Morgan Freeman is now a navigation voice in Waze:** The most recognizable voice in narration just made its way to your smartphone. [Morgan Freeman\u2019s voice is now a usable navigation voice in Google\u2019s free app, Waze](http://time.com/4232933/morgan-freeman-gps-voice-waze/). You should probably start using Waze for navigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n\n**Brief Introduction**\n\n\nHey! I\u2019m /u/justblais, the newest member of the /r/android content creation team.

             &lt;ul&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google will support Apple against the FBI:&lt;/strong&gt; You don’t have to live on the internet to know that the biggest tech headline of the last week has been the FBI vs. Apple; as we watch this fight for privacy unfold, we’ve learned where various companies stand on the issue. We learned via Android Central that &lt;a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/google-and-facebook-will-reportedly-file-amicus-briefs-supporting-apple-fight-fbi"&gt;Google, along with Facebook, would be filing court motions support Apple’s decision to not create an “fbiOS”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft isn’t porting Android apps to its phones anymore:&lt;/strong&gt; When Microsoft announced its next version of its phone operating system, one of the key points was that they would make it easy and painless for developers to port existing apps for other platforms over to Windows phones. We’ve seen little headway on Project Astoria (the Android side of this porting process), and received confirmation this week that &lt;a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-officially-cancels-project-astoria-bridge-porting-android-apps-windows-10-mobile"&gt;Astoria had been cancelled, and the project to run Android apps on Windows phones were dead&lt;/a&gt;. Some of you might say “Mike, why did you include this headline? Nobody cares about Windows phones!” And I agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motorola knew the Nexus 6 was too big, but Google wanted it:&lt;/strong&gt; I mean, at least they’re admitting it, right? Motorola told techradar this week that &lt;a href="http://www.techradar.com/us/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/motorola-admits-nexus-6-was-too-big-but-that-s-what-google-wanted-1315647"&gt;they could have made the Nexus 6 the same size as the Moto X, but Google wanted a phablet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nextbit Robin AMA:&lt;/strong&gt; In case you missed it, we had the Nextbit team on our subreddit this week to answer questions about their flagship phone, the Robin; the phone that should (hypothetically) never run out of storage. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/47e1rl/we_are_nextbit_creators_of_robin_the_cloudfirst/"&gt;If you missed it, go check it out!&lt;/a&gt; A ton of their team showed up, and they did a great job answering questions everyone put up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversible microUSB cable:&lt;/strong&gt; Listen, nobody believes that we should all be using Type C more than myself, but I’m including this in light of the S7 being a microUSB. &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/hands-on-with-the-micflip-reversible-cable-the-standard-for-all-microusb-cables/"&gt;Apparently someone invented a reversible microUSB cord and didn’t tell me?&lt;/a&gt;. It seems to be durable as well as reversible, and in testing the cord support quick charge. It might be too late now that we’re slowly changing USB spec, but if you’re using a phone that still uses microUSB, this cord seems like a solid investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet Mighty, the Spotify iPod Shuffle:&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome to our new segment, “Coolest Announcement of the Week;” it will only ever appear once, but I invented it because this product sounds awesome. Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming services available, and now a company has &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/23/11102010/mighty-spotify-player-ipod-shuffle"&gt;launched a Kickstarter for a small, iPod Shuffle-style device that works with your Spotify account&lt;/a&gt;. In the interest of full disclosure, I backed this product, because I think this is awesome. A link to the Kickstarter campaign can be found in the linked Verge article if you’d like to check out more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

             &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boost for reddit releases:&lt;/strong&gt; I take great pride in poking the large, burning fire that is the Great Reddit App debate, and I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t encourage you to basically try every single reddit app that is ever available. This week, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/47cq1b/dev_ive_just_released_boost_for_reddit_a_new/"&gt;Boost for reddit officially launched&lt;/a&gt;. It features the ability to filter what content you’re saving, so you can make sure you’re ONLY SEEING GIFS. REVELATORY FEATURE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morgan Freeman is now a navigation voice in Waze:&lt;/strong&gt; The most recognizable voice in narration just made its way to your smartphone. &lt;a href="http://time.com/4232933/morgan-freeman-gps-voice-waze/"&gt;Morgan Freeman’s voice is now a usable navigation voice in Google’s free app, Waze&lt;/a&gt;. You should probably start using Waze for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
